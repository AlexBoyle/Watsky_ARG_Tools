Headphones

[Chorus]
I can't hear you (I got my headphones on)
I can't hear you (I got my headphones on)
I can't hear you (I got my headphones on)
I got headphones on (I got my headphones on)

When I look at who's around
And it feels like two's a crowd
I don't run and hide
I just smile real wide
And I turn my music loud
[Verse 1]
It's not practical to react to bull
I was thinking too hard and I cracked my skull
It's natural, erase all doubt
If I take my 'phones off, then my brains fall out
So you can shout, empty out your throat on me
It just looks like you're lip-synching Obla Di
Obla da, every time you go, "blah blah
Blah" I'm hearing "life goes on" like it's your mantra
So talk shit, but when it's prone to go down
You're afraid of your own bull like rodeo clowns
I stay low to the ground, I stay plugged in
And when my dome needs love, 'phones hug my skin
But earbuds don't count, they're headphone loopholes
I want 'em bigger than a couple sideways soup bowls
And if you're sayin' next to nothing
Make like my playlist and get to shufflin'

[Chorus]
I can't hear you (I got my headphones on)
I can't hear you (I got my headphones on)
I can't hear you (I got my headphones on)
I got headphones on (I got my headphones on)

When I look at who's around
And it feels like two's a crowd
I don't run and hide
I just smile real wide
And I turn my music loud

Amplified

[Chorus: Rafael Casal]
I get up, when you get down to this
Keep cool, but still get loud to this
When it drops just can't deny
The mic's turned off but I'm amplified
So if you want to ride
This young son will come out tonight
And this one tongue will give out the vibe
With this mic off I'm still amplified (I'm still amplified)

[Verse 1]
We don't just write poems, we got a mic jones (Mike Jones!)
Giving a fuck, ripping it up in different time zones
I know it's so apropos that it's gotta be said
That I was flowing so hard in the car off the top of my head
When I drove home
That my own flows gave me road dome
So go bone, man, but fuck it if you're celibate
Screw the music if you do it 'cause you're sellin' it
Well equipped, man, we do it for the hell of it
Never delicate, hella ripped off the elements
Earth, wind, fire, water, top rock echo box

Yo man we got Cosby doing jello shots
I've been tellin' em the melanin's irrelevant
I'm yellin' and you'll feel it from the ceiling to the sediment
Intelligent, epic, and reppin' the Bay
You're trippin' if you're thinking that you're getting away

[Chorus: Rafael Casal]
I get up when you get down to this
Keep cool, but still get loud to this
When it drops just can't deny
The mic's turned off but I'm amplified
So if you want to ride
This young son will come out tonight
And this one tongue will give out the vibe
With this mic off I'm still amplified (I'm still amplified)

[Verse 2: Watsky]
The sun is comin' up and runnin' through me
If weather is gettin' better, don't be gloomy
Let's get together, gather up and get it moving and
If you don't like my motherfuckin' music, sue me
A new me, a new reason to be so unseasonably fine
The ill summer grill serving supper with free sides
Cut to the 'B' side
It's Watsky covered in batter and butter and refried
The speakers are pushin' the roof
The tweeters the woofers are proof
The meters are up in the booth
The subs, the mids, the highs
The highers, the lows, the cones all bump
Duh, we're amped, that's the god damn truth
We flowing low in this moment only to sew and be growin' over the roses and now that we broke it open we know that we're dope enough we're hopin' no one just can't get live
This is how we get amplified!

[Verse 3: Rafael Casal]
Yeah I got something to speak on
On the kind of song once heard you just keep on
We out in Cali here keeping the trees blown
So lean on me, need more gain than Freeman
Turn me up a little I'ma get a reaction
Yeah the game's filled up with a little distraction
But I'm passionate, yes, somewhat of a Manson
Here to murder words, maybe hold the rest of 'em ransom
Wonderin' what I'm gonna do to blow all them lids back I tell 'em to get back, that's how we leave an impact
In track-form, if you don't feel me then give me my disc back
And be ready to get you a diss track
Shit man, I'm playing but somewhat of a monster
When I get down to laying these songs
Soon we'll be there at a concert
Playing as loud as the
Bay will allow Watsky, good thing you're around to lead the crowd

Fuck an Emcee Name

[Intro]
Alright, first of all
There's already a popular reggae artist with the name Elephant Man
Second of all, as my mother always said to me
There’s nothing cooler than being yourself
And third of all, and most importantly
(clears throat)

[Chorus]
F-F-F-F-Fuck an emcee name
I don't need a goddamn emcee name!
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?
(George Watsky doesn't need a fucking emcee name)
F-F-F-F-Fuck an emcee name
I don't need a goddamn emcee name!
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?
(George Watsky doesn't need a fuckin' emcee name)
[Verse 1]
If I go spit a poem If I go kick a flow
Doesn't really matter man cause the jam is a Watsky
When I get a mic and I go rip a rhythm ain't a name in the whole damn game gonna stop me
Probably gonna rip it too
'Cause the city wants a hippy with a bit to prove
I got shit to do I got the sickest crew
And so what the fuck is it to you, dude?
If I got no stage name I got stage game out the ass
And a master plan, It's an avalanche
When I spit a little bit of slam
And I hit you with the battleram
Got a cattle brand "GW bar none" so what do you park man?
Got money and cars? damn, I study the stars
And I couldn't care less who you rep in your set show respect
I'll be rapping I bet
Lean to the left flow right Oh my god!
A rose by any name got thorns as sharp
Yo, stage names are for porno stars
And Watskeet skeet skeet skeet is far
From what I'm trying to do, who I'm trying to be
Mother f-f-f-fuck this industry
If I gotta be MC U to do MC Me
Georgewatsky.mp3
F-F-F-F-Fuck the limit I got a keep it coming if I wanna make it to the top
'Cause I be giving you what I been doing during the minutes that other rappers have been napping on the clock
'Cause if I walk the walk and I talk the talk and I'm popping off 'cause my flow is hot
Then I'm pretty motherfucking positive I never gotta try to be somebody I'm not

[Chorus]
F-F-F-F-Fuck an emcee name
I don't need a goddamn emcee name!
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?
(George Watsky doesn't need a fucking emcee name)
F-F-F-F-Fuck an emcee name
I don't need a goddamn emcee name!
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?
(George Watsky doesn't need a fuckin' emcee name)

[Verse 2]
What's in a name, man, flow comes first
I'm never gonna curse—that I got it worst when I roam the earth
It's a ridiculous coincidence that shows my worth
You know, my parents went and chose my emcee name at birth
I don't need a mask to cover my ass
So why would you ask? Go put me on blast
I'll take you to task
This name is my last (gasp) so put it on my tombstone when I pass
(Here lies a fine emcee, the kind who grasps the fact
That these aren't circus acts to make you clap, it's rap to make you think and act)
I think you understand by now the thought involved
That if I wanted to be called another name I would have scrawled it on the bathroom wall
I'm not apologizing for a policy that makes a college kid go call himself Thugdog and not expect assault
I'm marching on and calling all dissenters who
Would like to be included in this emcee designation coup
I'm set to get a crew
We're gonna get a clue and then we'll put it up for you to view
Coo coo ca choo I am the "insert you"
Come on everybody do it too
[Chorus]
F-F-F-F-Fuck an emcee name
I don't need a goddamn emcee name!
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?
(George Watsky doesn't need a fuckin' emcee name)
F-F-F-F-Fuck an emcee name
I don't need a goddamn emcee name!
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?
(George Watsky doesn't need a fuckin' emcee name)

[Interlude]
I invoke the spirits of the great nameless emcees who came before me:
Tupac Shakur
Ali Shaheed Muhammad
Sean Price
Saul Williams
Dahlak Brathwaite
Michael Franti
Gabriel Teodros
Joell Ortiz
Mike Jones
Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park
I invoke the spirits of the great nameless professional athletes turned rappers who came before me:
Deion Sanders
Roy Jones Jr
Shaquille O'Neal
I invoke the spirits of the great nameless white emcees who came before me:
Fred Durst
Aaron Carter
Kevin Federline
Ommm...

[Chorus]
I don't need a goddamn emcee name!
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?
(George Watsky doesn't need a fuckin' emcee name)
F-F-F-F-Fuck an emcee name
I don't need a goddamn emcee name!
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?
(George Watsky doesn't need a fuckin' emcee name)

[Outro]
F-F-F-F-Fuck an emcee name
I don't need a goddamn emcee name
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?
F-F-F-F-Fuck an emcee name
I don't need a goddamn emcee name
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?
F-F-F-F-Fuck the limit I got a keep it coming if I wanna make it to the top
'Cause I be giving you what I been doing during the minutes that other rappers have been napping on the clock
'Cause if I walk the walk and I talk the talk and I'm popping off cause my flow is hot
Then I'm pretty motherfucking positive I never gotta call myself somebody I'm not

Seizure Boy

[Intro]
Seizure boy?

[Verse 1: Watsky]
The first thing that happens is the world goes black
You just hear a little snap when your neck rolls back
You don't bite your tongue off or foam at the lips
But before you hit the ground there's a moment of bliss
It's like toking a spliff, it's like shedding your skin
It's better than the best train wreck there's even been
You have to let it in, as much as it's upsetting
To wake up with bruises you don't remember getting
You don't remember how the hell you ended up indoors
You don't remember whether you were wetting your gym shorts
In front of Amanda, the girl you're after
Who already thought you were a fucking disaster
It's not like a last will, it's making me laugh
Unless you get your next one while you're taking a bath
I'm seizing the mic fast at middle school dances
I'm done being seized and I'm seizing my chances
[Hook: Watsky]
I said, "It's all too much"
I said, "It's all too much"
I said, "It's all too much"
And if the world breaks your legs you go and beat it with your crutch
I said, "It's all too much"
I said, "It's all too much"
I said, "It's all too much"
And if the world breaks your legs you go and beat it with your crutch

[Verse 2: Watsky]
Maybe true
I got baby blues
You got navy blues
Paid your dues
Name the tune
Name a hue:
What shade are you?
I see Purple People Eaters more than world leaders
And I've jumped a couple hurtles, burned some sneakers through the meters (copacetic)
Please, get the medic
Let it breathe
And I'll be the baddest motherfucking epileptic I can be
I would grieve
Asking why's it me sleeping in the ER with an IV in my arm and my V card hurting saying, "God fuck if I'ma die a virgin"
I'ma grab the first nurse working, flirt and draw the curtain
So who's perkin Doctor Phil's Pills
Tyler Durden Still ill
Thrillville, Uma Thurman hurting in the Kill Bills
This is to my sick kids
Time to flip this shit
Depakote, Adderall, Ritalin, pixie stix
I don't give a fuck what you ridin' to the setting sun
Use it as a weapon when it's said and done

[Verse 3: Watsky]
Say that I'm crazy or call it a pitfall
I'll win a game of bloody knuckles hitting a brick wall
It's pinball hitting the limit to smash that glass
Taking a minute to sit in the whip and then I'm gonna mash on gas
'Cause I'll be crashing that impasse with fat ass syntax
Skinny motherfucker off a bucket of Slimfast
You ever had a Gran Mal seizure in gym class?
Had whiplash back when life was dishing out pimp slaps
Fed up and we've all been better but I'm set to step up
Never let up 'cause the fall is just the setup now to get up
Regret'll never get the better of me with a sawed off
When I'm having trouble talking someone knocks my writer's block off
If my eyes glaze and my knees drift south
And you ever think to stick a credit card in my mouth
I take Mastercard and Visa for my risk rewards
I'm not biting my tongue, why don't you bite yours?
[Hook]
I said, "It's all too much"

GOAT

[Intro: Watsky & Guy]
Haha ha ha, that was funny man
That was funny?
Yeah. So what's the, uh, what's the real track 4, though?
The real track?
Yeah. That's- you're not actually gonna put that on the record though
Yeah. That's actually track number 4 on the record
Watsky
I'm telling you man, it's not a stretch. It's possible to be funny and serious at the same time
Y'know. Poignant
Watsky
Yes?
You have to like, disrespect women and talk about clubs and shit, like, that's really important nowadays. That's what they want on the radio man
Y'know, it's a track about, y'know, juvenile epilepsy and I feel like it'll be touching and-
See okay- You shouldn't have gone anywhere past juvenile. Think JUVENILE. You didn't say bitch ONE TIME IN THAT RECORD
No, but at the end of that, eh-
Sprinkle it man. Sprinkle some disrespect on it
Sprinkle it?
Sprinkle a little disrespect on it. There's no disrespect on the record, it's too nice
You need to have the big fucking glasses, a funny hat, where's your T-Pain effect?
I want you to go back, go home, and write a better song with more bitches, fuck more peoples'... mothers. and sisters. and brothers. and grandmothers and shit
Then come back here, and we'll talk
Lemme bounce with the beat for a second. No homo
[Verse]
Uhm, yeah. Whoo !
Get in bed like I'm at war
Make your vagina more than kinda sore
I'm hung like a dinosaur
Shit your hymen tor
You're busted
You never grew up like a Toys R Us kid
I'm well-adjusted like jock strap crutches
Bang my old teachers while the preschool watches
Met a slow girl, I was fucking her fast
Had some tight old pussy and got stuck in the PAASSSTTTT
I molest old age, Grab the best old babe, in a breast hold babe
Is your chest cold babe?
Are those boobs your goosebumps?
Hey sugar tits, can a pimp have two lumps?
Measure my heart prick, whatever the night
I use my dick as a yardstick to measure my height!
I'm healing myself, I have a hole in my pocket
And I'm feeling myself
I'm like WuTang, your arts cookie cutter like a Warhol soup can
The rapper who can destroy mere humans
Fuck your facelift, fuck your played whip
I built a spaceship, to ride in while you're crusing Earth
Lampooning all the aliens that emcee in the Universe!
The ten best rappers is a list of me
I exist to be, the greatest rapper in history
Built a time machine from Flava's clock and a saddle
Taught Plato to rap, then kicked his ass in a battle
I'm the best rapper alive
That gets mistaken for Michael Cera everywhere he drives
FUCK MICHAEL CERA
You weren't so super bad
When I was writing and
You were running around Rodeo yelling
"Who's your dad?"
UH!
Man, fuck this

Waking Hour

[Chorus: Mariami]
In the waking hour I see your face
In the waking hour I feel your (Oh)
In the waking hour feel my body race
In the waking hour
Baby I see that the game is unspoken so if you play with me
I don't need nothing broken
I've got patience you see
And I don't mean to preach that's it's a man's world baby
But a woman will teach you to believe
[Verse 1: Watsky]
You were on the bed in that pretty little thong
With a ribbon on it, when I said to pick a song
You had a feeling for some healing with that Marvin Gaye
Begins with "let's," ends with "get it on"
I get it. you're ready to fuck
And it's time for me to let it erupt
But. I got a confession to make
When I get nervous
I can never get it up
I gotta get it together, I better meditate
I want to set it straight
I gotta separate the passion I had
From the fear that came
Alone I get a boner when I hear your name
But when I'm near the game, I veer to shame
Clearly, my dear it appears the same
Severely lame!
My genitals' flustered
Make a last stand like general custer!
I'd take a cluster fuck or a just some animal lust
I know you're looking for a man who can thrust
(trust) I was in the sack with a faster women than Danica Patrick
When I had a panic attack
I can never fake it, I make another mistake
And I'm aching and so I pray to the have the pastor take
An erection collection and pass the plate
But no one donated, so I had to masturbate
I know the girls want it
I'm close, and if it grows I can put a condom on it
Her moan is onomatopoetic
I groan. because my bone is gone as soon as get it
Got a risky trick, for frisky chicks
Have a drink, then blame it on whiskey dick
Wait a couple hours, I'll be horny good

[Chorus: Mariami]
In the waking hour I see your face
In the waking hour I feel your (Oh)
In the waking hour feel my body race
In the waking hour
Baby I see that the game is unspoken so if you play with me
I don't need nothing broken
I've got patience you see
And I don't mean to preach that's it's a man's world baby
But a woman will teach you to believe

[Verse 2: Watsky]
I know that many men are waiting
To be penetrating
You think I'm panting
But I'm hyperventilating
I would get to mating but I'm so damn nervous
I called my dick, but I can't get service
The worst is I'm a pervert- I want you
I'd make harness from your tan brassiere
Last night I had a fantasy
We're banging hanging from the ceiling like a chandelier
Slip into your chimney singing "santa's here!"
But it's a grand veneer
Damn, it's enough to bring a man to tears
With a hand on my gear
But a strand full of blanks in my bandoleer
There are times when I wish it away
There are nights when I wish I was gay
It'd be quicker- I go to theater school
Shit I figure I could stick it to pick of the litter
Man I'm sick of it
Want to stick a dick in it, lick a tit
Get some cliterature, for the illiterate!
Hit it in the middle of the night
In the waking hour
When I take a shower, we can strip
Luckily I studied up on being cuddle buddy
Would rather have sucker who fronts?
Fucking you once, making ugly grunts?
I'll be casanova (in a couple of months)
I'm making you mine
Maybe later for the sake of taking our time
Tonight we can lie naked
If you don't mind waiting
Give it like five dates and I'll have your thighs shaking
I get her in bed and then we're attending a seminar on a bit of sex ed
I hope this song proves
How fast my tongue moves
Cause it's true I give the best head
[Bridge: Mariami]
I go to sleep just to wake up in your arms, babe
And before the dawn you'll rise when the sun say
Early mornings make me restless
Breath on my skin, I'm already breathless (oh)
You're sexy under pressure, boo
Better catch your breath so that I can let my hands perform for you baby
We're all alone, help me untie my blue sarung
I can't wait to tell my girls, "Yeah, that's my man
So good I had to write him a song"

[Chorus: Mariami]
In the waking hour I see your face
In the waking hour I feel your (Oh)
In the waking hour feel my body race
In the waking hour
Baby I see that the game is unspoken so if you play with me
I don't need nothing broken
I've got patience you see
And I don't mean to preach that's it's a man's world baby
But a woman will teach you to believe

The Girl Next Door

[Chorus]
It's a song about the girl the next door
I love the girl next door
The world's next door
They see her- everybody melts
She's the girl next door to everybody else
It's a song is a song about the girl who sings
And every time you hear her sing
She sings for you
And you alone
And every other guy you know
She loves you back
She says she's with it
Loves you back
But wait a minute
All along she loved ya back
Enough to put a dagger in it
It's is a song about the girl the next door
I love the girl next door
The world's next door
They see her- everybody melts
She's the girl next door to everybody else
[Bridge]
So, funny story
I was really into this girl, a great singer
And I had this musician friend who was really into the same girl
She ended up essentially playing us off each other
But, we both had these songs that we were going to do with her
So we just put them together

[Verse 1]
It's like a fairy tale!
About little chickenhead
Thought the sky was falling
So she kicked it sick and dead
I came calling (she pretended she was dead)
Feeling she was healing but the ceiling fell instead!
You feel stellar in your skeleton?
Tell a guy you fell for him then tell him he's irrelevant?
It's evident you think you're Helen of Troy
But you're hell in a handbasket
Hell of a coy little Cruella Deville
If it's fitting you fill in
Another filthy felony with every fella you thrill
You're cellophane
But there's a spell on us still
A man goes window shopping
And you sell him the sill
You give an illness that isn't a silly pill or some silvery penicillin
Or pity gonna fulfil and so willing my pen is spilling I'm drilling my point until
The pen point's dull
The end point's still
Insight, I'm inside, I'm insisting
You get wise and quit with lip-synching
In Christ, you entice the quick kissing
Rise in a bathtub full of ice with a rib missing (It’s aliiiiiive!)
It's been decided
You can lie, but you can't hide it behind your eyelids
I provided rhymes and had to plan a hybrid
With the man that led this band who might have liked you more than I did
Or maybe as much
Cause baby that's what
Make me want to laugh
Just, breaks me right in half cause
It really adds up
Dwelling on this sad stuff
Celibacy mad sucks
When everybody tapped once
Including a best friend
Then one of my roommates
You said it was just then
But shit it was too late
So what's your group rate

Guess that's the problem
When you have a bunch of people who are artists
You end up falling in love because they're amazing on stage and it's too bad
Because she really does sing like an angel

[Verse 2]
Here! is where you would have sung the verse
Here! is where you'd have to catch a breath
Here! is where you might forget the words
Haha that where you'd laugh to fill the rest
Here! is where you'd hit another high note
Here! is where you'd make it pretty, shit if I don't
Here! is where we'd really try to be friends
Funny how the shallow girls end up off the deep end
First I met your ass last year
First day of class, you were mad sincere
Then you went and chose my friend for benefits
Then he did the same and said it was the end of it
Then funny thing, I got up on the TV
Then coincidentally you said you'd like to see me
Then you stood me up on just our second date
Out with mister music
Then you used him for your serenade

[Chorus]
It's a song about the girl the next door
I love the girl next door
The world's next door
They see her- everybody melts
She's the girl next door to everybody else
It's a song is a song about the girl who sings
And every time you hear her sing
She sings for you
And you alone
And every other guy you know
She loves you back
She says she's with it
Loves you back
But wait a minute
All along she loved ya back
Enough to put a dagger in it
It's is a song about the girl the next door
I love the girl next door
The world's next door
They see her- everybody melts
She's the girl next door to everybody else

Run My Mouth

I tend to vent a lot
It's hard to end a thought


I get pent up and I guess I don't know when to stop
If I get a mental block, you can hear a pencil drop
But if not I'm all talk like a rent a cop
I don't wanna mock
Ever yet I let it slip
Said I gotta get a grip
Cause I know you're delicate
And I'm pretty adamant
I can learn some etiquette
Bet on it that I can talk a book and never edit it
Seldom elegant, guilty of embellishing
Yelling but I'm holding shit together like I'm gelatin
We're both jealous and selfish, I'm hella slim
But I gotta bigger mouth than a pelican
Check a fella sing, messing up the melody
I know my alphabet, A to L-M-N-O-P
I like you, it shouldn't be shocking
My heart's beating just as loud as I'm talking
[Chorus: Danny]
I know you know
I know you know
Sometimes I say things
I don't quite mean
Ca-a-a-a-an't I run my mouth?


[Verse 2]
I'm a fast talker
Louder than a brass knocker
Cricket or a grasshopper
Not another. word
I don't want to ass kiss
Sniffing like a mastiff
That'll be my last ditch
Effort to be. heard
Take me as a hostage
I'm feeling lost
With my neck out like an ostrich
Totally absurd
I squawk like a bird
Cause my clumsy heart feels like it's doing cartwheels
So maybe you can
Put me in a dunce cap
Treat me like a hunchback
Say my mind is one track
Every single. day
Call my mug a megaphone
I don't beg and moan
If I get in bed alone
I don't want to say
You're forgiven briefly
If I call you sweet pea
Then you say to eat me
And I don't know which way
I've had a taste and I know you're gourmet
An argument's just the makeup foreplay


[Chorus: Danny]
I know you know
I know you know
Sometimes I say things
I don't quite mean
Ca-a-a-a-an't I run my mouth?


[Bridge: Danny]
Listen
Calm down
Hear me
Watch your mouth
Careful
That stung
Give me lip
Bite my tongue
I'd say
Stop that
But we both
Talk trash
How about we work it out?
Listen
Calm down
Hear me
Watch your mouth
Careful
That stung
Give me lip
Bite my tongue
I'd say
Stop that
But we both
Talk trash
How about we work it out?
[Chorus: Danny]
I know you know
I know you know
Sometimes I say things
I don't quite mean
Ca-a-a-a-an't I run my mouth?


[Verse 3]
Take the silent type, gimme the opposite
You look so damn sexy when you're talking shit
Every time I want to say to put a sock in it
I melt again and buy your ass a box of chocolate
I guess that's why they call me Georgie Porgie puddin' pie
Before I kiss my girl I put her on a sugar high
And then we cry after a little old 'how are you?'
Turns into an argument I bet'll scar you
Is it hard to always have to complain
Taking something mundane and give yourself a tongue sprain?
You talk about your day and go off for a year
And I could walk away or hold the phone off of my ear
I don't love what I hear, but I've got to stay
Cause man, smart girls have a lot to say
I want to shout with someone that I'm down with
There's no one I'd rather run my mouth with


[Chorus: Danny]
I know you know
I know you know
Sometimes I say things
I don't quite mean
Ca-a-a-a-an't I run my mouth?


Who's Been Loving You
[Hook 1]
I know my Momma loves me
I know my Poppa loves me
I know the camera loves me
I can tell my brother loves me
I know that Boston loves me
And San Francisco loves me
I love the city back
I just can't help it, it's so lovely

[Verse 1]
I'm in my lucky underwear, I'm feeling debonair
If it's a lonely trip to heaven, I'm already there
I'm in the bedroom and I'm stepping like I'm Fred Astaire
I make it happen, battle rapping at my Teddy Bear
When I was twelve I'd leave my door open a crack
Afraid of getting busted sneaking porno on my Mac
I guess I was a freak
Until I got caught last week
(who's been loving you?)
I was reading Booker T, I threw the book at me
I go for the lookers but they never look at me
I would get a hooker if I could unhook her bra
I'd be looking soft as soon as she took her top, off
Let's go rolling in a broken Winnebago
Stop and smoke a bowl out of a hollowed out potato
It's hash now, but it's hash browns soon
(who's been loving you?)
[Hook 2]
I know that Jesus loves me
I know that Buddha loves me
The fucking Easter Bunny
And the ghost of Gandhi love me
I know that Santa loves me
And the ghost of Gandhi love me
I know that Santa loves me
I think my Aunties love me
I know my Grandma loved me
She thought I was handsome trust me

[Verse 2]
This insanity, that's heredity
It's my family, we can let it be
Wish I pretended that mom and dad are dead to me
But I love my dad, that motherfucker read to me
My first words were "where's the love?"
Mad smug, assed up on a bearskin rug
Fashodo, my mom'll show you the photo
(who's been loving you?)
I do embarrassing better
I could wear a pink sweater
With a pair of slick pleather pants
Derelicte e-va-ry day and it's well known
That I hop off stage with my cell phone
Fake a dropped call when everybody's near me
And shout "I love you mom!" so everybody hears me
I need it too and true nothing new but
(who's been loving you?)

Even though I owe them money
I think it's pretty likely
That my whole family loves me
My lovers tend to like me
I know my homies love me
My teachers loved to hate me
The haters love to fuck with me
The fickle love me lately

[Verse 3]
I'm a percussionist. I never knew guitar
It's cheesy, but I'm stunting like a superstar
It's easy man I'm hopping out a moving car
Call me Weezy cause I'm coughing at the hookah bar
I don't do cigars, but I got hella game
I can make a lady out of styling gel and cellophane
So you can yell my name, I make the bed frame move
(who's been loving you?)
Me and my better friends are heading to the town strip
If they don't let us in we'll never take round trip
Because I took an hour picking out my outfit
And then I took another slicking down a cowlick
And I like house sitting, but fuck it now's different
I'm going out and there ain't a bouncer for cow tipping
So I'mma tear this joint up
And I'mma party till the hoofs point up
(who's been loving you?)
[Hook 4]
This is for Charles Barkley

I Got This Love
[Chorus: Passion]
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because

[Verse 1: Watsky]
Because of Jonestown
Because of Auschwitz
Because the leaves fall and we can't stop it
But that makes fall leaves
I'mma start a mosh pit
(ch!) This is your captain
Hopping out the cockpit
I forgot my parachute
But I got my bay sounds
So I'll be going dummy
Rocking on the way down
I'll be saying, "Hey ground!"
Howzabout we make out?
I'll put on some Ray Brown
You can grab some take out
Love isn't more sin, love isn't forced in
Getting under your skin, digging for endorphins
It's the portion some of us'll forgo
Fingers on your torso tapping you in Morse code
The opera aria we're singing like a bar song
The stranger's pretty face that hits you like a car bomb
The wrinkled note we passed in class in second grade
And all it says up on the page (is)
[Chorus: Passion]
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because

[Verse 2: Watsky]
Because my Grandma lived to 99-eleven months
Between a hundred years of solitude and heaven once
Because she loved her son but couldn't ever say it right
Because the language of the planet isn't day and night
It's in the in between, it's when we intervene
And never let a silly hater rabbit pimp the scene
For the deaf kid in the aisle of the symphony
Who hears it through the rumble of the tuba and the timpani
For those lay waste to beauty with a straight face
Everywhere on earth we're all escaping from the same place
And, yes, occasionally we get drunk and out of line
Last night, there's a lamp post that I asked to be my valentine
Take a shady place, shine until it radiates
Seventeen to eighty eight, make a break and head west
Or make a promise to your lady in a red dress
Last night in my hot mess
That lamp post said yes

[Chorus: Passion]
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because

[Verse 3: Watsky]
Detroit is equal till there's half its people laid off
While corporate lawyers and former employers play golf
Because of furor over every juror paid off
And because the Führer used to be a boy named Adolf
Because of Anakin, instead of panickin'
And because of every man who can be more than just a mannequin
Because of Tienanmen, because there was a cameraman
And because of the cameraman chasing princess Diana and
Because of Tammany hall, because of Gramercy park
Because of Amityville and because of amnesty
Because of famine and because its not a fantasy
Because of every tenement into family
Tentative to say cause of combs cause of hannity
Homes for humanity the bones of my ancestry
Grown and gone on gravestones and drawn on payphones and palms
Raised up in alms

Fight Fight Fight
[Verse 1: Watsky]
Spun a web of lies, took notes from Charlotte
Throw a red herring, paint the White House scarlet
Pennsylvania Ave was the last red carpet
Then Bush relapsed like a rehab starlet
I feel carsick
Stop the Paris Hilton carousel
Hot as hell and smells like kerosene and caramel
America's flaring and we're carrying parasols
Paranoid of terror cells, parents scared of aerosols
Said if you care at all, fight for the ones who fall
Fight for the ones who can't, fight for the one for the all
And fight for the ones who rep, and fight for the one percent
At the bottom against the one-two-one-two step for the ones who come correct
I don't wanna sit back with a Big Mac and a rack of natty ice
Six pack on my lap, skinemax on blast, sticking to the facts of life (Right)
Said if you're taller better follow who you're steppin' on
Cause I'll be brawling like the fightin' Irish leprechaun
[Chorus]
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse

[Verse 2: Dahlak Brathwaite]
Since I was little I’ve been fiddling with the riddle
Focus like folks addicted to Ritalin craftin' it with no chisel
You soft as Malcolm in the Middle
I’m strong as the Nation of Islam with Malcolm in the Middle
Uh Izza, Uh Izza, can you save them
Playful like skittles or that little minstrel delicious was kissing like a switch
Switch it up like a schizo
Pretty motherfucker would get ugly like Gizmo
It’s okay maybe it’s not your day
I’m a winner couldn’t even get beat by Dr. Dre
I couldn’t even get beat if I was your slave (Yay)
I got [?]
My designer clothes look like [?]
Angry like sin case thoughts once his chains unlocked
And this is why I’m hot
But not in that M.I.M.S sort of way
More like you better get him sort of way
Cause until I kill Bill he won’t put his sword away
Been a professor like you got your tenure today
Got my vendetta to settle I ain’t settlin' for close
When it comes to wantin' change I’m as unsettled as Mos
Spittin' live from the boondocks
With my boombox
Sittin' on my soap box
Spittin' got my folks locked
They patiently waiting for me to give em' some of freedom fighter
Kind like Huey Freeman of 21

[Chorus]
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse

[Verse 3: Watsky]
I don't need a chart to see that I look hard to me
There's no Chardonay pumping through my arteries
And my heart’ll say I should take the harder way
If I got a part to play, I won’t make it Bartleby
At least this Starter T is feeling like an armor piece
It's guarding me like it’s righteous artistry
So far to lead us to inagaddadavida
To seeking god in your freedom
To God I gotta lead a vida bonita
Cause see to lead a beautiful life
Is more than eating, sleeping, and meeting suitable wife
You gotta fight
While Luda’s throwing bows in A-town
I’ll be throwing blows like little children on the playground
You should know the bay, we're seeming sorta tame
But we can go insane
And if you’re on lower plane like when a Boeing lands
My fist detaches at the wrist, so I’ll be throwing hands
[Chorus]
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse



Color Lines

[Verse 1: Watsky]
Your first rap show posted in the back row
Of a sea of white kids bent on supermanning that ho
Pretty soon you're buying fitted hats and high tops
Pretending that you're black enough and rapping with the lights off
It's like a cyclops with one closed eye
You can tell me that you're winking, but the grin won't lie
And no mouth supplies, what your skin tone hides
About a thousand miles south as the jim crow flies
And then we're playing he said she said
I see red when I peep a pink cheeked boston meathead
I wanna go Bruce Lee
When I see him on the T taking up two seats
And say, "excuse me, but would you move if hell froze?"
You know the subway is the underground railroad
Lynch trees have the same white limbs
Check out my arms, I look just like him
[Verse 2: Catch Wreck]
Let's you and I get one thing straight
The game never been equal, ain't no food on my plate
I gave birth to this and you just took it and co-opted it and profited
And packaged it and wouldn't give me half of it
Peep how I master this and break down how you took it all
Raped the culture and you standing there looking all
Innocent, take a mile when I give and inch
And how you getting rich, is it a coincidence?
Or is it ignorance? You don't know your own privilege
You own riches and don't know what homeless is
You got a lot to learn before you even think about
Hip hop, black culture and which fitted you pickin out
Play Nigga in the store, I don’t think so bro
My people ain't supportin your black history show
So stop what you doing we won't take it anymore
Before you come in my house wipe ya feet at the door

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Watsky & Catch Wreck]

[Watsky]
I see the color lines
It's tough that every other time a brother rhymes
White mothers think of gutter crimes
We keep our standard higher
We don't kick lower rhymes
Other times it undermines the fact the mine are over minds

[Catch Wreck]
All you gotta do is get past the guilt
We ain't living in a house that master built
If you overstand that, tell your people what you know
Because one of em got enough money to pay back what you owe

[Watsky]
Yes, My great grands had land, had slaves
I guess I pressed this record off the bank he made
But I want independance, past the declaration
But one down ass white boy can't pay for reparations

[Catch Wreck]
I'm running out of patience while you do the work of Satan
Like an impulse. Edu Leedz Black history's an insult

[Watsky]
Number one, I'm not trying to tell your story
I just want to sit on my porch, drink a forty and spit
Number two, cause uou can smell bullshit
I just love hip hop
Pinkie swear that's it

[Catch Wreck]
If you love hip hop respect it
That includes the people who created it and paved the way for this
So that you're making it
[Watsky]
Well if you're talking on who's making it, I'll play devil's advocate
A lot of black music has white dollars backing it
Kweli's got it on lock
Rupert Murdoch funded Rawkus
You looking for the keys, then you better check the pockets

[Catch Wreck]
I'll be checking pockets all right
As soon as it gets dark and all night
I'mma get my money we can all fight

[Watsky]
You taking out the high and the mighty
And their kids
You say kill whitey
I say can I live?
You're not black militant
Killing us diligent
Grab my fam, and grandma and light us up like a filament
I thought we were cool now I'm this close to giving in
Just put a bullet in for each missed dose of Ritalin


Hercules
[Hook]
I know I'm just as strong as Hercules
Because it's wired in my circuitry
And if I'm just as strong as Hercules
You'll see I'm just as strong as Hercules

[Verse 1]
In 1638 they came from Sweden
Ship shape settlers late looking for Eden
The Delaware tribe wasn't really keen on leaving
So they "bought em out" or slaughtered them quick and got to breeding
1659 they built a fortress
Stationed soldiers, and gave them horses
But now their forces were losing their resources
Moving in the living quick as moving out the corpses
Started changing courses, when we got the Quakers
And they been running town since Cromwell met his maker
They didn't take pay cut, Quakers got their cake up
The paper came triangulating, trading with Jamaica
Now in the 1700s they took care of biz
Built the families through some noble marriages
Still in WiIlmington, doing what their parents did
Living up on 7th street in Mansions they inherited
1800 and in step the du Ponts
Irenee du Pont was fleeing the war in France
He made the jaunt cause apparently murder rate
Was higher for gentle people spitting on the third estate
He started working late, he had grand design
And when we cut a couple fingers off the hands of time
The du Ponts were running under Delaware like panty lines
They built a mill for small explosives on the Brandywine
But gun powder's just as temperamental
As the rich kids with CEO potential
It's essential to compete for our emergencies
Which brings me to a company called Hercules
[Hook]
I hope I'm just as strong as Hercules
I hope I'm just as strong as Hercules
But when it comes to stacking currencies
I'd like to be as strong as Hercules

[Verse 2]
Hercules Gunpowder started kind of small
DuPont had it all, were sparkling wall to wall
They were ballin' in the fall of 1899
When T.C. du Pont crawled up the Brandywine
Now Thomas Coleman, started as a coal man
In the mines in Kentucky with his old man
Joined whole fam, and flipping the strip tease
Went from fig leaves all the way to big cheese
Never got on his knees for the love it won him
From couple of brothers, Lewis and Russell Dunham
They were running shit with Coleman's muscle
Lewis wasn't clueless
But Russell's on his hustle
Now brother Lou, was Coleman's true blue man
T.C. would have an idea and Lou drew plans
DuPont had seventy percent of GDP
When it came to gun powder and TNT
They bought even bought Hercules
"Scandalous!"
Said the government, so brought on anti-trust
Litigation, and they split business up in three
Into Atlas and DuPont, and Hercules
But certainly they were busting heads
Put in work at Hercules, then made Russell prez
In 1912 up the road from Dover
My great great grandfather Russ took over

[Hook]
I know I'm just just as strong as Hercules
I know I'm just just as strong as Hercules
Because It's written in my history
I know I'm just as strong as Hercules

[Verse 3]
Russell Dunham, we said Daddy D
Or sugar Daddy D to half the family
Ran Hercules as an affable property
Slap on the wrist from capitalist democracy
And so between TC and Papa D
A bit improperly they adopt a monopoly
And instead of dotting the i's and often crossing the T's
They take a walk in the trees, and talk and pocket the cheese
And when Russell dropped to his knees, his heirs cashed out
Every generation after the shares passed down
(So where's that now?) Split between six ladies
And my mother had the stocks till the 1980's
If Stonewall pays my phone calls
If San Juan fills my Scantron
If every molten shower out in Okinawa fueled by smoking powder
Pays my broken power send my folks the flowers
If it's irrelevant to my intelligence
Gimme a shotgun, I'm dropping these pink elephants
I'll take a tranquilizer shot and sell the sedatives
Out in Delaware I'm well aware the fella lives
(And what if Iwo Jima)
All the skeletons in my closet are dead relatives
(And if the Fall of Saigon)
And then I grow up to be another screw up
(And if the Tet Offensive)
But if I blow up
It'll be cause they blew up
[Hook]
My mother loves me more than Hercules
My parents work harder than Hercules
But if I think of this as burglary
I know I'm stronger cause of Hercules



Two Blue Moons

[Verse 1]
A couple red sons popping out a new womb
Twins come twice, once in a blue moon
Feeling like a joke in the nude, rude humor
We were born premature, and they said "Too soon"
Sing a new tune, act less fickle
Most twins cling like a pair of testicles
We haven't been tight since we breastfed little
Said me on the right and you on the left nipple
Said it's that simple, have to discover
If you act a bit smothered while you're trapped with big brother
9 long months kicking it inside our mother
Never kicked her belly, hell, we only kicked each other
If we suffer we can get well when we grow
Get born, ready? Go! Got a separate embryo
Breaking like a levee though, wading through the heavy flow
When you see the light, let me know (bro)
[Chorus]
The moon is out tonight (It's bright)
Is everything alright? (Not quite)
I wouldn't act like I know (No) know (No) know (No) know (No) know
Just what you're going through (No shit)
But if you're feeling blue (Don't quit)
I want to tell you, my brother, I feel the same way too

[Verse 2]
There were weeks you can bet I couldn't eat
Looking at my cooking with a set of wooden teeth
Opened up my big mouth, found that I could speak
So I put another foot in it, but now I couldn't leave
It's good to see all the losers taking days
To think of dumping shit on you in new, creative ways
You can say that it's a phase
Or some rude complaining crap
It's a stupid way to act, man, but two can play at that
I've been a brat, made more than one slip
My lips got unzipped, I quipped some dumb shit
Our folks were so sick, it made them cringe
I followed my jaw's lead, and came unhinged
I'm sorry man, but can the shit end here?
Cause we haven't really talked in about ten years
And that's ten too many cause if you were anyone else
I wouldn't see you in myself

[Chorus]
The moon is out tonight (It's bright)
Is everything alright? (Not quite)
I wouldn't act like I know (No) know (No) know (No) know (No) know
Just what you're going through (No shit)
But if you're feeling blue (Don't quit)
I want to tell you, my brother, I feel the same way too

Aching in the chest, try to take it from the stress
Shrink made me quit, I was making him depressed
Usually I'm upbeat, tearing through the halls
But instead of bouncing off 'em I was staring at the walls
Care to make the call which separates faster
A fence of placenta, an inch made of plaster
A handful of strands of our DNA
Either we both were alone or it seemed that way
Kept to myself, I'd reflect by myself
Dude, I left and I fucking saw Shrek by myself (Oh no!)
It's no help to assume we're less than
To mom it's yes ma'am, I'm groom, you're best man
It's on the next fam to plan and proceed
But if we smoke weed, don't think we OD'd
No I don't know all the shit you've been through
But I've seen a window, and I know I've been too

[Chorus]
The moon is out tonight (It's bright)
Is everything alright? (Not quite)
I wouldn't act like I know (No) know (No) know (No) know (No) know
Just what you're going through (No shit)
But if you're feeling blue (Don't quit)
I want to tell you, my brother, I feel the same way too


Everything Turns Gold
[Chorus: Mieka Pauley]
When the sun sets on the city
It's something to behold
Cause when the sun sets on the city
Everything turns gold
For now you're young and pretty
And you'll be lovely when you're old
Cause when the sun sets on the city
Everything turns gold

[Verse 1: Watsky]
The frog in my throat was the size of a mutt
The fat toad ate the butterflies in my gut
The dog in me knows that it's a bitch in dark black
So I spit the frog out and I took my bark back
Till that I'd been afraid of night
My cradle never stayed in sight
It might have all abated if I played it right
I hated tryna find and face a place I didn't dare go
Diving with the worms and liking looking like a scarecrow
Do a mellow jig instead of tripping off a dollar
I'll just skip the yellow brick with wicker sticking out my collar
It's all or nothing I'll be cultured when I'm older
Fuck a parrot, I don't care I'll feed the vulture on my shoulder
(Polly want a collarbone?)
Try the lake for fish
Or just say yes to yesterday break it and make a wish
I ate dirt as a baby, I did it for the flavor
In a couple years I'll let the dirt return the favor
[Chorus: Mieka Pauley]
When the sun sets on the city
It's something to behold
Cause when the sun sets on the city
Everything turns gold
For now you're young and pretty
And you'll be lovely when you're old
Cause when the sun sets on the city
Everything turns gold

[Verse 2: Gift of Gab]
Yeah
I used to consider the riches and the props
And the houses and the fame and the fortune, everything
Seems when you get here, there seems more desirable
All that old fear doesn't leave, it's inside of you
Everything material, it passes like the night'll do
Into day
Came and went away
Nothing penetrates the void that illustrates the noise
Mental states annoyed with a attitude of zero gratitude that may destroy
Beneath the lies is truth though
You seek and find the proof
Only place to be is here
Dig in, peep it how the roots grow
From out of nowhere into nothingness and back
Constantly expresses everything and everyone
And acting as a thread
Arm Leg Leg Arm Head
Karma that you spread
May be relived again after you live again after you're dead
Until you merge into the blissful field of mighty power
But time is an illusion, all of it's within you now

[Bridge: Watsky]
The sun is going down
Drink another round
Play until you fold
Paint the city gold
Remember what you've heard
Don't say another word
Until you shake your bottle up and spray a little on the curb
Remember what you own
Take the sunset home
If no one's out right now
I hope you know you're not alone
Try to find some nights
To watch the shining lights
Park see the city sparkle out on diamond heights
All those attractive glass spires
That we love to stack higher
I'm starting grass fires
When my car backfires after four flat tires  I’m
Rolling off road to avoid the bad drivers
Coming back home and I climb the walls into the sky on tall risers
To make it all brighter
So blaze your lighters up
Raise your cider cup
And let's pull an all-nighter
[Chorus: Mieka Pauley]
When the sun sets on the city
It's something to behold
Cause when the sun sets on the city
Everything turns gold
For now you're young and pretty
And you'll be lovely when you're old
Cause when the sun sets on the city
Everything turns gold
When the sun sets on the city
It's something to behold
Cause when the sun sets on the city
Everything turns gold
For now you're young and pretty
And you'll be lovely when you're old
Cause when the sun sets on the city
Everything turns gold

A New Kind of Sexy

They’re Not Ready

[Intro: Watsky]
*clears throat*
...watsky?

[Verse 1: Watsky]
I'm that dork up in the orchestra on oboe, trick
You're just trying to get some chickens on your pogo stick
But they'll be hopping off it when you stop the profiting, and then with no dough you'll be like a Dodo when you go extinct
I'm in San Francisco sipping on a boba drink
Tapioca in my palm I talk how Yoda thinks
The voice is so distinct
I like to write my rhymes with lemon juice
And so if you don't get it it's in coded ink
Better believe this
I'm ready to meet Jesus
Either him or Willford Brimley when I die from Diabeetus
I've never been defeated since da fetus days
Lead the way
Raged out my momma's VJ, crazed and freed the slaves
Wait I take it back, that's racist and I'd need a time machine and I'm not pleased to be like T-Pain, a fleeting phase
But since my pre-Ks in PJs, I pre-date the Bieber craze
I've been rhyming crispier than Frito-Lays

(WATSKY!)

A New Kind of Sexy (Song)

[Hook: Watsky]
I got a new kind sexy
I'm working on a recipe for rich
And exotic combinations of some fresh kinds of sexy
A new kind of sexy

[Verse 1: Watsky]
My face is like the California government
In terms of how it tends to budget what it's covered in
Hair follicles are public school doors
Every day I open up a new pore
And close two more
But it's improper now to comment on what's risen
Because pimples pop up commoner than prisons
It's all blackheads-- no justice now
But they get overcrowded and I bust em out
I'm like Pop! Pop! motherfucker, I'm a bad man
And some day my skin'll crack like the Badlands
Like my dad's is
But if that's all, I don't give a rat's balls
I'll wear them like they're badges
Damn a boyscout
They're manscout patches
Because I'm endowed, and how! Dammit
And I know my body makes you want to hang out bad
The way my skin is cleaner than a Shamwow ad
And someday you'll see my stubble from the Hubble
On my mama on the double I'mma look like Barney Rubble
[Verse 2: Intuition]
Yo, I'm something like a Harry and the Henderson's
Notice every time my knuckles be married to the pen again
Cause follicles be flying out my wide pores
Double standard cause I love my body hair but mind yours, girl
I'm grizzly-esque, you bet he thinks the Yetis wonder "Is he blessed?"
My shoulder hair sheen like a solar flare
I'm a polar bear seeking out a bowl of Nair
Was he fuzzy from his childhood or early days?
Every time I cook I guzzle up a dozen curly strays (yucky)
My tweezers stay plucking
Your girly gets to floss her teeth every time she's, well
Kissing on my lower regions
The reason that I keep hair's cause it's good for colder seasons
But in the summer time I'm the asshole
Sun bathing at the beach, belly like an afro
I got a plan laid for my next bland date
Tell the boring breezy wait I forgot to manscape

[Hook 2: Watsky]
But for now
I got a new kind sexy
I'm working on a theory of a new
And experimental blend of different rare kinds of sexy
A new kind of sexy

[Verse 3: Dumbfounded]
I got a couple regrettable tattoos
But you can't see them when I wear a black suit
Got drunk off of Jagers out in Vegas last June
And them water parks kids yell "Look at that douche"
You know saying 'if looks could kill'?
Well my style is harmless, I shop at GoodWill
End of hipster, swap me hood feel
Four strip Adidas but that shit look real
Call me a fashionista, skinny dude
Give me food, cash or VISA
A freeloader who reeks of weed odor
Trying to get the freaks to scream like Ricola
One chick for me and one chick for Watsky
He love them older women that be screaming out "Yatzy!"
Topsy-turfy, I'm not so pervy
Compared to Intuition, well like them girlies
We like them brown, Puerto Rican, or Haitian
A new kind of sexy is sweeping the nation

[Verse 4: Watsky]
I'm impatient but
Yesterday I bought a pullup bar
I made plans to go jog down the boulevard
I changed my culinary choices from full of starch
To full of shit
It's a total farce
I haven't run a lap in years
But I'll crack a beer
And run the poker table like a fucking racketeer
Boom shakalack-fuck
Let's have a potluck
I got a hot buck burning a hole in my pocket
So let's hit the tac-truck
Jock's suck
Just throw everything we got in the wok
And let's grub till it looks like we're knocked up
[Hook]

JT brought sexy back, but it's a cheap one
So I brought that sexy back for a refund
A new sexy's begun

Danger
[Hook]
I ain't afraid, I'm the man, I'm the great
I laugh in the face of danger
I'm on the edge so you best be prepared
There's something in the air, it's danger
I never cared, lions, tigers and bears
I ain't scared, you can bring that danger
If you want to survive, better stay on your side
Or you're putting yourself in danger

[Verse 1]
I drive a hooptie, not a Humvee
My bed's hella comfy
Sometimes I get hella clumsy
You more He-Man, me more Gumby
You more Bun B, trill
Me more One Tree Hill
Me Will
You Uncle Phil
I'm nothing but a punk with skills
If that's confusing, then I'd like to ask you humbly chill
Cause last I checked, it was a fucking free country still
I'm so hungry. It's time for din din
We do our thing thing
All we do is win win win
And then draw some
Because I fight with my friends, and my friends like to win and they're awesome
And if you cross em
Well then you crossed me
And you better watch out
Cause if you watch me
You know I fight to the last for my fam and my friends are my fam so a friend is a Watsky
[Verse 2]
I never pack switch blade (Danger)
But in the middle of the night I run a black ops fridge raid
Jackpot, man, never play the good cop
When I'm at the kitchen door negotiating push pops
I just got here. watch your boy stay
Stepped in the building and I'm chilling in the foyer
Oy vey. man I'm colder than the South Pole
I don't give a damn if it's a no-shoes household
This bonehead's in his PRO-Keds from outset
That's why I stay grounded like a three-prong outlet
It's how I pull off looking like a Boy Scout, yet
I'm rocking sneakers that are cleaner than a moist towelette
And yes, my rider calls for Grey Goose and Applejacks
How I rose so fast from the cabbage patch
I use some four letter curses, and then I drop a triple word score that'll scrape you in a Scrabble match

[Verse 3]
Here comes lover lover, on some other ish
Quick to blow up like a pufferfish
The toughest puppet with
Purple plush stitched in my flesh
Snuffaluffagus up in this bitch
On some raw rubber ducky shit
And you muggles mean mugging
Better cut it quick
Chuck another diss, and then pucker lips
Kiss my voluptuous hips
And then button it
Stopping fuckery's on my bucket list
I like monsters under beds, But I'm a kitties and puppies man
Slap that peppermint frap from a yuppie's hand
Didn't clean my room. I puff the magic dragon
So go ahead and stuff me in the paddy wagon
You dilly-dallied while I called shots
I'm not babyfaced, my beard's got bald spots
Fresh mind, mentos for my mental
Fuck the #2, I use a #1 pencil

Kidnap Your Boyfriend

[Hook]
I was just thinking that I really like you
And I was just thinking I really like you
And I was just thinking if I kidnap your boyfriend
Could I be your boyfriend?

Verse 1
I've gotta time it right
I've gotta plan it through
You're a stick of dynamite
Hope that I can handle you
You're a whole new animal they couldn't hold a candle to
So I demand a candid answer, what's a man to do?
Could pay a camera crew
Get an editor set up in his kitchen with the video and kid and put his ass on Catch A Predator
Call his creditor
Tell em he's in heavy debt and with fed on red alert
I plant a care package, a bear trap with the teeth padded
And when he grabs it, then I beat it like Br'er Rabbit
Or I could lock him in the liquor cabinet
Drinking, thinking, sad until he kicks the habit
And if he gets lovey dovey
I'll take a kindergarten keep him in the cubby
When we leave for winter break and someone gets the pet I'm gonna pawn him off on little Betty like he was a guppy
[Hook]

Verse 2
It's a minute to midnight and
That's my cue to pull up in my big white van
Beckon him with my charisma
Chucking snickers at him like it's his Bar mitzvah
And if someone heard that racket
Better bet I'm gonna bag him in a burlap sack
Your dude's whack
He lacks the X Factor
(Bookmark boy) I can be the next chapter
What do I do for the women who tell me they want me?
That when I got over the one who steadily haunts me
If I get over the one
Then I'll be ready to party
Then I'll be looking at Blondie
On me get up and calmly walk away
It's pretty pathetic
I get it, but not today
You wanted to play
You want me to act tough?
Spend every dime
But I won't go bankrupt
I said to be easy
Could you please back up
All these Jenga beezies they just don't stack up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
But if I'm too blunt, I can mask it
If time's a blunt, I can pass it
I'd rather pass with the passenger
Shotgun the messenger
Call off the massacre
Your dude is cool
I wish I didn't have to mess with him
To tell the truth
I want the very second best for him
I'm positive I'm not pessimist
I'm not jumping
I'm just pissing off the precipice
If I deafen to the definition and I never getcha
God I betcha I'll be better cause I metcha but be I'm missing always waiting for day you'll be available
You keep on stating who you're dating ain't debatable
But baby, maybe we could pick up when this shit ends
My sixth sense says we're clicking like we're Bic pens
I don't wanna read the writing on the wall if it's only gonna end like Annie Hall

Women, Women, Women
[Verse 1]
Looking out my window
Talking to my cat like he's kinfolk, I sip a coke and I drink slow
I'm in limbo, no plan B
No girlfriend, I just need to meet a nympho
But I won't cause I'm more sensitive than my lymph nodes
And I give too much info
You can't unzip after saying dumb shit like
Like I hear your name every time the wind blows
I gave a chilly chick my jacket and my skin froze
And then she jacked it and just ran off with my thin clothes
I guess that shit makes her a heartbreaker in my windbreaker
I'm not tripping off the bimbos, I just think about the puns that I can spit later
She couldn't salt me, she was just a hip shaker
And to answer the question that you implied in your eyes
No, I don't think that I'm smarter than a fifth grader
[Hook]
Ladies, Ladies, Ladies
Women, women women
Honies, honies, honies
Girlies, girlies, girlies
Ladies, ladies, ladies
Bunnies, bunnies, bunnies
Women, women, women
They're my honies, honies

[Verse 2]
Reality valedictorian
Graduated to the next level and I hopped in my Delorean
Aurora borealis in my rearview, man it's glorious
Waking up at noon, I'm notorious
I'm gonna roll the dice, I'm very lucky, but fuck it
Papa needs a new pair of Huggies in this life of hard knocks
Feeling like the Hulk, I throw my enemies against the wall across the room like they were my alarm clock
After dark, car parked right on our block
Arm wrapped around the card stock chick propped up in the passenger seat for a sweet one-way heart to heart talk
I think I'm ahead of my age like I'm Dippin Dots
These women that I've dated lately really seem to think I'm odd Strange, they just nod, which is hard
Without a head on their shoulders like Ichabod Crane

[Hook]
Ladies, Ladies, Ladies
Women, women women
Honies, honies, honies
Girlies, girlies, girlies
Ladies, ladies, ladies
Bunnies, bunnies, bunnies
Women, women, women
They're my honies, honies

There and Back Again
[Verse]
Sometimes I think I'm too honest
But to be honest, I'm sick, I'm bubonic
But less black than the plague which is vague
'Cause the Black Plague as a name's kinda ironic
In that most black folks don't actually kill entire populations
Of European people, or move chronic
"Who said they move chronic?"
Were you away, cuz? 'Cause if you ever smoked bud
You know tress make you cough like the plague does
"I hold my smoke in, toke up, lightweight Yankee
You'd faint from a baby buzz"
Fuck you random English guy, take a long nap
This is my song, begone, move along, chap
"Bugger!" Yeah, that's right, walk away, bitch
Remember what my name is (WATSKY)
Good, now that square dude is gone, we can party
Let's get some mardis gras beads, weed and Bacardi
"The weed's gone, that British nobleman smoked our shit
And no one noticed it"
Who cares, bro? I'll party sober, I'm over it
I'm with my dogs yo, my Dobermans
At In-N-Out feeling dope and shit
It's a local thing, I get the cheese fries
Then go home for a Boca burger and a mocha drink
I go to Yogurtland, blowing smoke rings
And speeding in the fast lane, yodeling
Road soda tucked in the lap of the kid riding shotgun
When the cops roll past motioning for us to pull over
And I don't, I blow past a tollbooth
Doing donuts on the shoulder, knowing I'm the Sofa King
I won't brag, but believe me, I know swag
I'm feeling so sav
My friends in the backseat follow our police chase live
On the plasma screen headrest TVs that I don't have
They warn me about the spike strips
I swerve, and I fly through the 'burbs, but then I hit the curb
And my tire pops; I flee on foot, but get tired, stop
And invite the the firefighters and the night-cops out to IHOP
This is the life, homie, why knock it? I get high fives
When I pop the top off my beer bottle with my eye socket
I'll be fine
I'm bleeding but the best beer-goggles is to be blind
"Ahem. Is this seat taken?" Is that you, British fool?
I can't see shit, but know there's a seat vacant
"It's me." Well sit down, dude, there's mad room
We just got food, but there's bound to be round two

Pumped Up Kicks Remix

[Verse 1]
I've been on the blacktop
Steady throwing elbows
Ever since I was was in corduroys and velcros
Ever since you did your impression of Melrose
Pace
A giggling gaggle of Tickle me Elmos
I ate some wheaties and graduated to shell toes
Running from a bully, man I'm thinking hell no
Chain me to a tree, I'm waiting for the bulldozer
You only woulda seen skate away if hell froze
May not be bigger but you're never gonna pick on me
You're Cedric Diggory. I'm Nicholas Nickleby
You better pick a team
There's no in between
You want a nickelbag
You want some nicotine
You wanted a fix
I will never be your goldmine
Taking my kicks
And I'm hanging em over the phoneline
So you can find me, posted feeling so fine
[Verse 2]
At Buena Vista elementary in second grade
One whistle is when recess ends
Two whistles is an earthquake drill
Three means every kid better hit the deck
Unless you want to catch a stray bullet or a ricochet from a fight across the chainlink fence
I know that I don't look it but grew up in the middle of the city where only the quick make friends
A kid in Frisco
Navigating Lombard
No On Star
I'm on BART
No lawn darts
Not saying I'm hard
But I got street val for my pokemon cards
Better put me onto Pawn stars
And I'll Barter like my gramma when she wants art
Every block or two I skate around another beggar
Leaning on a cop car
Baked as a pop tart

D.A.N.C.E Remix

[Verse 1]
6th grade, I remember my first dance
Steady searching through the mix for a slowdance
Like the marshmallow pieces in the lucky charms
Cause that's golden your opportunity for romance
But on the fast songs the numbers between
That's when you get to show the lovely ladies what you mean
It's when the fellas preen watch me C-Walk
How I strutted and displayed feathers like a peacock
They did the Funky Chicken, I learned the Dirty Bird
'Cause the Atlanta Falcons did it in the endzone
After every touchdown. It didn't help me score, did it at the dances and it put me in the friend zone
And if I went home, with my head down
I lift my chin up
Then put it down again
Up again
Down again
Up again
Down again
Now I'm headbanging to the brand new sound again
[Verse 2]
Your body is a temple
My body circus ring trying to hold itself up like a tentpole
Every instrumental makes my pencil neck snap back fast until I'm going mental
Some call it grinding, some call it bumping, but in the Bay we had a funny way of speaking
In San Francisco, we're the kids of hippies, just a bunch of geeks so we called it freaking
In 6th grade, freaked with a 8th hottie named Janny and I sang Kumbaya
Amen Halllujah!
Until a hater chaperone came and made room for God
It's all good though
Turn the anger into energy and passion tlll I'm burning like a wood stove
I do Liquid and the Fireball
The only raver moves I know
But I'm putting on a good show

Pauly Shore Saw My Penis

[Verse 1]
You couldn't see a lot with our crotches under froth
On timer-jets the trouble started when the bubbles stopped
Now, if you wanted, you could see each little boy wand
Bobbing there as clear as little goldfish in a koi pond
And I was hot and pruny, as dry as Styrofoam
I needed to escape the tub like Pauly from the Biodome
I know no boychick's poifect, but I made the noble choice
And hoisted myself out of the moistness
Slowly which exposed my joystick
And Pauly must have seen it, plain as I'm waving at you
Because I stood there dripping, naked like the David statue
Pauly I've gotta ask you because I'm just not psychic
If my penis was a Facebook post, I wonder if you'd like it
[Hook]
All my life
I prayed for a friend like you
And I wish I could glance at your Linus too
But you wore a fucking Speedo, you bitch

[Verse 2]
I can't express just what it's meant to me
To have my genitals vetted by a celebrity
And one with Paulie's pedigree, I'm talking Breeder's Cup
If Charlie Sheen had seen my peen, it wouldn't mean as much
He doesn't have the Weasel's touch, I'm not some stupid groupie
This dude was in Biodome, Encino Man, A Goofy Movie
And probably other stuff, I just think it's fucking nuts
That Mister Pauly Shore himself was gazing at my buttercups
I dreamed to be discovered, I hope the wait is over
Not sure if this is it, but either way it's great exposure
And I can't blow this chance to have a bro romance
I hope he picks the fruit that dangles from my lowest branch
I'll pick the slowest dance, I just can't handle this
Perhaps I should expect it at a men's spa in Los Angeles

[Hook]
I wish I could see your pud too
But I'd Twitpic your dillsnick, it's true

Ask Me Anything

[Verse 1: Watsky]
You want to know
Then I'll try
To tell you how it is
There
Isn't ever much
Cracking the coconut hoping to get me to open wide
Now
If you want to know
Then all you have to do is ask me
I don't have a thing to hide
I walk in the office of my orthodontist and without a warning
My jawbone is already pried
And honestly, I've never lied
Second to none
If I pucker my lips and I lickem I'm looking to kick an impeccable pun
I don't kick it like Beckham
I kick it like Beckham a decade ago when I run my mouth
You think I'm a megalo-maniac
A lout?
I'll be begging to differ
Try sticking a flute or a piccolo
Up a particular part of your pecker
But I'll let you pick it though
I'm out
I'll chuck up a deuce-- a bigalow
And be cracking a Michelob
And I give a toast
And I trickle a bit in the gutter for all of my bigger bros
And I walk it out
Now
If you want to know
Then all you have to do is ask me
Not a thing to hide
I'm trying to be totally open like all the time
Now
If you want to know
Now
Then all you have to do is ask me
Not a thing to hide
Now
Not one damn thing
Now
Not one damn thing
And I'm glad I got all of these ears around
Me
Not one damn thing
And I'm glad I got all of these ears around

Ten Fingers

[Verse]
Never have I ever seen Passion of Christ
Never have I ever crashed on a bike
Or been trapped on an island and had to survive
And yeah, I'ac from a bird bath, never tried to fly (Brrrr!)
And yeah, I'm known to cop a dub sac
But never have I ever rolled my own blunt wrap (That's true)
Never ve been trashed on a Saturday night (Yeah)
But never have I ever smoked crack from a pipe
I've never started one slow-clap in my life
I never, ever sat first class on a flight
Or drank cognhave I banged to Purple Rain or Dove Shack
Never have I ever loved and been loved back
Fun fact, 'cause I've had a broken heart
But I've never, ever, ever put a woman over art
And I'm never gonna start, never cheated on a chick
But ask me if I've lied, then I'll likely plead the fifth (That's my right)
Never have I seen a ghost or a spirit (Nope)
But if one appears, then I'll know when I'm near it
And if I ever fucked a prophet, I'd be quick to repent
But I've never known Jesus, in the Biblical sense
(Ahhh!) But I've I think we'd be friends
If he went to my school and was cool and we kicked it in chem
I've never kissed a dude (Eww); well, that's partly true
Are we counting Spin the Bottle at a cast party, too?
Oh my God, so gay! Pause
Tick-tick-tick-tick, press play
I've never raved, I've never been tased
Never maced, or been maced, or been punched in the face (Not yet)
Never have I ever contemplated suicide, or been crucified
Never have I ever mooned another driver from the side of my hooptie ride (Woop-woop!)
Never have I ever swallowed all my foolish pride
(Womp-womp) And I can't really tell
If I'm a good person or I'm faking really well (Not yet, not yet)
'Cause every now and then I'd catch her on the phone
But I never really went to visit grandma at the home
And I've always known that I won't be happy
Until I'm the best version of myself when I'm alone
So fuck thinking of marriage
Until I learn to put another person first and be a parent
I pinky-swear it

[Hook]
I don't know much, I
I won't know much, I
I won't know much until I
Until I know myself
I know I don't know much, I
Know I don't know much, I
Know I won't know much until I
Until I know myself
I know I don't know much, I
Know I don't know much, I
Know I won't know much until I
Until I know myself…

Energy

[Hook]
I'm lookin', I'm lookin' I'm lookin' for energy, everywhere
I'm lookin', I'm lookin' I'm lookin' for energy, everywhere

[Verse 1]
My head's up in the sky it's higher than the clouds are
I like to look up at the stars and wonder how far
From what I hear about a billion babies are delivered every day and so it's like the planet is a clown car
I know it probably shouldn't work, but we all fit
Like a Mickey D's Playplace ballpit
So lookie me, I'm about to jump up in it and be swimming through syringes like a mothafuckin dolphin
I could have an outburst
There's a lot of freaky people on the planet and it makes me want to crowd surf
Everybody everywhere dig downwards
It's what we work for
Party at the earth's core!
I don't know where to go to go far
But if I go, then I know I should go hard
And if I go and I never come back
Then I'll send a postcard
And a couple thumb tacks
[Hook]
Said I'm lookin', I'm lookin' I'm lookin' for energy, everywhere
I'm lookin', I'm lookin' I'm lookin' for energy, everywhere

[Verse 2]
Teacher said this party started with a loud bang
The way my ears are ringing I don't hear a sound mang
I'm steady looking at the crowd like a proud dad
For coming out instead of clicking on a mouse pad
Steal a bounce house, fill it full of helium
Ride it like a blimp because I think that It'd be really fun
To do a triple flip in zero gravity while puffing on a philly blunt and shooting stars with a BB gun
Tonight I'll look at something that I've never seen before
And I might even pen graffiti on a meteor
I can reach it, homie Veni, vidi, vici, it's all peachy got a vision of the future on a Ouija board
I didn't believe it, I
Thought it was CGI
Why don't you decide
If we're computerized?
Assuming you and I are alive
And tomorrow is the rapture
I wonder watcha wanna do tonight

[Hook]
I'm lookin', I'm lookin' I'm lookin' for energy, everywhere
I'm lookin', I'm lookin' I'm lookin' for energy, everywhere

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't wanna
I don't wanna I don't wanna end up as an anybody
Everybody is an anybody
Made of arteries and antibodies
And you never get to see confetti without getting bloody
If you read ahead you'll all be surprised
Spoiler alert!
We're all gonna die
But I'll be hooping in that driveway in the clouds
Shooting fouls with that big orange ball in the sky
And when I die wanna say well I made it
And be way celebrated
And remain as a staple
If I stay hella faded
Then I'll fade and my fate'll be the same as the fakers with the chains on the labels
It's a shame people do it for the fame and the cash
Not the flame and the passion I train through the pain and I frame every passage as a way to stay fit
Cause an 808 kick is my gatorade drink

Show Goes On

[Chorus]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on
[Verse 1]:
I don't really give a damn about a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow if it's being on a billboard
From the moment I saw Chali 2na rocking under the multi-colored lighting in concert at the Fillmore
I'd kill for
Punks and b-girls
Never gonna matter I'll be spitting like a water cannon making waves I'm an orca, I recommend a parka you'll be feeling like you're in the front row at Seaworld
Gonna hike it till I make it, it's a good call
Taking the mic and I spike it like a football
Like a running back
Like I'm under the gun but I'm never gonna crack
Never could fall
It's like I'm Arnold I'm
Skinny but I'm picking up a barbell fine
Gonna make it putting my pen to the paper poppin' out a novel in a minute
Like I'm R.L. Stine
Gotta try because I got a fool's chance
Grab the mic at a middle school dance
Take it from the DJ and I rap until they pull the plug out on me to stop it or until I get pants'ed
Fuck it, they can pull the plug I'm gonna kick it acapella, Dockers at my ankles, and I tell em what I'm feeling
Even if nobody is listening I yell it to the ceiling and I celebrate the fact that I'm alive and I'm breathing

[Chorus]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on

4am Monday

[Verse 1]

I know why they call them labels
Because you have to fit a label now to fit a label
But If I'm a pussy, then I guess I did my kegels
I got it on lox, I'll bring the bagels
It kind of feels like middle school again when they call
I think the majors can't decide if I'll come play ball
If I can make them money
If I can dumb my shit down enough
Or do the dance
I think it's kind of funny
They might be right, I'm shaped different like Toblerone
I turned down a quarter mil to pitch a mobile phone
Cause I believed that I can be more and walked away
And left my hand up in the air like I just shot the J
White rappers make it quicker if we talk like stars
Hit the A-list
Cause you puffed on Ls
And dropped your Rs
Let's pull some video out of 5th grade pageant
And compare the way you talked then to how you're rapping
You think you sound the same?
Or that you picked up the way to be real in somewhere TV-Land along the way?
If I just get 15 minutes I'm gonna stay myself
And when that 16th minute comes then I won't hate myself
Maybe I'll never get signed
I'll fucking flatline
But nobody gets to raise a banner during halftime
Win or lose, I always choose myself and place a bid
And make the same face on every play like Jason Kidd
[Hook]

It's almost 4AM
Monday in my room again
Got a crazy vision of a dream escaping from my pen
I'll be swinging going down
Fuck that noise, No way no how
You're listening to this song
But I'm working on the next one now

[Verse 2]

If my goals are odd I take as a challenge
People seem confused by how I hope to use my talents
Could he be weird Al, could he be Jimmy Fallon?
I tell them to imagine Mos Def meets Woody Allen
Haters give me balance. Every Kyle's got a Cartman
I know how failure tastes
I drink it straight from the carton
I always keep a gallon in the fridge at my apartment
To remind me how it feels to drop the ball like Stevie Bartman
Believe me I want to achieve it all by being me
It's too easy to be cheesy on TV or DVD
I'm seeking to sneak in, but I'm weeping when I peep the scene
Cause I'm knee-deep in it and need a TP roll to keep it clean
I'm digging for a deeper meaning cause beneath this skin is a beating the temperamental heaving heart of gentle heathen
If you deceive us, homie that's so sad
I'll get more agro than the Aggro Crag
I'm Boney Boney leave me aloney you know me well
Don't dwell on that Jabroni just cause that baloney sells
His flow is hole-y like the edge of abalone shells
I want to flow holy like matrimony bells

Amazing Grace

I used to think I was a Marxist
Now I go to less marches
It's not that I don't want to start shit
But I don't want to start shit
Unless it's where my heart sits

I don't keep a knife under my seat
To join the revolution and spill blood in the street
Rather have a discussion over a bottle of Bud
Or a puff on a blunt and then get something to eat
I used to ask strangers if they believed in a God
To see if we were peas in a pod
And if they didn't agree with me
Then I'd argue and try to be smarter
Thinking I'd hear people applaud

But I'm getting older
And I'm getting dumber
Or least I know less
Than I did when I was younger

I used to profess
Now I'm more pro-wonder
I used to fear death
Now I'm set to go under
No, fuck it, I still fear

This life is too top-tier
And it's like we just got here
We're more than an Uzi on a navy plane
Or Lazy Susan cruising on the gravy train
We're the tingle up your neck
When you see the sunset
Filter through the dust
As it settles on the Waves of Grain

Yes, the Waves of Grain on the stolen land
Theft is as American as a Cola can
Yeah, it was sold to Sam
Tell it to the mother of the little girl
On the trail of tears as she holds her hand

Damn it, this was built on something ugly
But with all my heart, man, I believe in this country
The beauty of our constitution
Have you read it lately?
I swear, it's really pretty lovely

It's really splendid
It's like our forefathers penned it
Inspired by some early Eminem shit
It's like they meant it
It's like they dreamt
That all the fences that divide us would eventually be mended-
Or rather torn down

So I don't think it's un-American at all
For us to ask for even more now
Let's talk it over, over more rounds...

What do you say?

* (A New Kind of Sexy Bonus Track)

“I don’t want to brag, but
I spent so much time at the top
That I got caught for loitering

I insulated my house with swag
And got swag poisoning

The righteous path is like my waist:
Real narrow
I sprint along it, pushing all my swagger
In a wheel barrow
But I’m over swagger
See these poser rappers
Think they’re goblins but they're goobers
So I gobble’em
You battle me, you’re gonna have a white boy problem!

And I guess that I should stop at nothing
Now to rock’em, sock’em, knock’em dead
But I don’t want to waste my breath
I’ve got respect for oxygen
And I don’t want to walk a block in Waka Flocka’s moccasins

The heap of crappy rap online’s colossal
It could topple, I don’t know why I bother to scoff at the debacle
But you’re so awful that I have to LOL and ROFL

You’re a lost dog, I’m a boss hog
And damn svelte
Actually, um, I really need to hold my pants up
And I’d rather use the champ’s belt
Or I’ll just go nudist in my human pelt
I mean, I think it’s super that you’re looking for a tutor
You could use the help
I’m wiser than my age
And so I plagiarize my future self

I’m not ashamed of intelligence
I came to the game with all relevant elements
A liquid flow so solid that I had to gassen’em
I go bananas just to boost my dosage of potassium
To push it to the maximum
To pop my pecs and flex in the excellence

You know I get it
I’d be pissed off too if I got bested
By a thin, self-deprecating, lisping Jew
But what’s-a boy to do?

I mean I only end my pieces so the audience can get closure
I go ham and it’s still kosher
I mean if you’re unsure if my boast or brag is a joke
I’ll try to let you know in subtle ways
My punchlines are lost baggage:
You should get’em in a couple days

But hey, there’s no cypher I won’t jump in
I’m liable to say somethin'
Screw a stand-in, I do all my own stuntin’
No steroids or supplements
Me in the game’s an odd sight, like
Non-white Republicans
Herman Cain’s, Bobby Jindal’s
I can’t explain it so I just
Throw in some Illuminati symbols
Pop these simpletons like pimples
Be very visionary
With a very busy world like Richard Scarry
While your picture’s next to ‘dingleberry’ in the dictionary

I don’t sling rocks, I bling lots
Ask Gringott’s
You should know me
I chucked homes like OE, OD and go cold turkey
I’m the young, clean version of Old Dirty

You’re a toy

You’re a toy that’s slapped together, packed and sold from factories
That’s why it’s easy for me to play whack-a-mole with wack MCs
I’m the common factor linking 2Pac, Babe the Blue Ox, and the Maccabees
In fact I snack on wack MCs like a blue box of mac and cheese.”

(Backing track: Ludacris - 'Go 2 Sleep' starts here)

These baby MCs all look hecka tuckered out
So I tuck 'em in or stick a sucker in these suckers' mouths
I'm like "bucka bucka bucka" you can't sit yet
And when you spit up, it's like you learned to spit from dipset
I got a double-barrelled Nerf gun and I'll clap mine
When I go "brap" I'm sending rappers to nap time
Sit on my lap, and by reciting your wack rhymes back
I send you to a sleep that's so deep you flat-line
You've got a little tuft of hair but can't afford a wig
Which sucks because your head is disproportionately big
It's a beacon of weakness, I can see it from space
Jesus it's freakish, but you're no baby genius
You're an average baby at best, a dumb baby at worst
I go "humm baby" and talk trash when I'm rounding first
These MCs are ticklish. You want a little sip?
You get hungry instead of horny when you see that nipple slip

Nothing Like the First Time
Ninjas in Paris 

[Intro]
The first time I listened to Watsky
I was like, "He sounds like a fucking honky"
And I don't even think he knows
But then, I listened to him some more times
And don't tell anybody about this
But, he kinda goes hard, though
(Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me)

[Verse]
I'm driving to the 'burbs and before I am coming back
I'm pulling in your driveway and I'm rolling front to back
I'm shifting forward, then reverse my car a bunch
As if my Subaru's a wiener getting sexy with your cul-de-sac
L-O-L-O-L, I'm from the avenue
A rapping labradoodle, half a WASP and half a Jew
If you's a Saturday cartoon, I'll smack ya black and blue
I'm ackin' ratchet with Daffy Duck and snacking on rabbit stew
Yabba-dabba-doo, I gotta lick my lips
Smoke a bowl with Yogi Bear, I'm sticking up your pic-a-nics
All of this is in my head, my 'magination's colorful
Crayons on the brain, I'll scribble silly shit all on my skull
Holy cow, I don't think they're gonna hold me down
I recommend you listen to the record in a theater with the Dolby sound
And I'm sipping on the coldest round with the preppies and the Goldie Locks
But I bet a bunch of hunnids everybody's gonna scatter any minute when the police knocks
Like "Sorry, ociffer, that getting sloshed occurred
But rastas broke in and they made us all smoke lots of herb"
I'm sorry, Honest Abe, po-po, don't take me 'way-way
'Cause if you ever try to lock me up, I'm pleading cray-cray
And then they'll all say, "May day, may day, oh, what did we do?
He be creepy givin' me the heebie jeebies, he be Hebrew
He be robo, beep-boop-beep-boop, please untie me, he's behind me"
What's 50 grand to a motherfucker like me, can you please remind me?
(A lot. That's...a life-changing amount of money for normal people)

Rich Girl 

[Hook: Hall & Oates]
You´re a rich girl, and you gone too far
´Cause you it don´t matter anyway
You can rely on the old man´s money
You can rely on the old man´s money
It´s bitch girl, but its gone too far
´Cause you it don´t matter anyway
So money money won´t get you too far, won´t get you too far

[Verse 1: Watsky]
Am I the only one who thinks a bit of soul is nice?
Some women suck it from you like the poltergeist
Cause I can tell the time of day without a diamond on my wrist, I give a __ about your rolly's price
I like em bold, and I'll roll the dice
Cause I been crushing on all these crunchy granola types
I'm over being over it and women on a mission got my heart melting like polar ice
I might
Be looking for a little bit of Bay
A little San Francisco in these women in LA
Ashe
Nothing I can say
And if you're being fake
You should be walking away
I don't play babe
Don't give a damn how low your earrings hang
Your favorite brand, I don't need to hear it, dang
Cause Everybody's born naked and maybe later I'll be licking on your Gucci
And you, rubbing my Vera Wang
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Watsky]
Sooner or later you'll figure out it's a hard world
You could get stronger doing arm curls
But this is a stickup and I'm coming saying break yourself, better give me that heart girl
Just put it in the bag
And if I give it back
Don't put it in the trash
Cause I been looking for a partner with a passion saying
Don't recycle
Don't recycle me
But in this economy
I don't really think it's cute for you to flaunt your property
What about some modesty?
That would be a shock to me
Cause the only time you walk on the block is on a shopping spree
Mother-eff that song and dance
Baby girl there's not a chance
Not unless you wanna grab a coffee in pajama pants
We'll be looking like we just rolled out of bed together
All we really need is you and me

[Talking]
[Officer] You need to go to City Hall to get a permit
[Watsky] Alright
[Officer] You need to stop what you're doing
[Watsky] How much would that permit cost?
[Officer] I don't know, just go to City Hall and talk to a special events organizer and see if they can give you a special permit for that
[Watsky] Okay
[Officer] I'm really sorry


[Outro: Hall & Oates]
So money money won't get you too far, get you too far
IDGAF 

[Intro]
What a beautiful, sexy night
What a shame someone would try and mess this up right now
Look around
I mean, I hearing everything you're saying
But to be honest with you
I don't give a fuck, dude!
(Let's go!)

[Chorus]
Let me tell you about my GPA, four-O, straight A's and my-
(I don't give a fuck!)
Let me tell you bout my resume. It's so cray, It's insane and my-
(I don't give a fuck!)
And my boyfriend, he's so hot, and the car that he bought me is-
(I don't give a fuck!)
And my "ooh-la-la", my "blah, blah, blah" and (I don't give a fuck!)
[Verse 1]
Cause I'm a bachelor, so fuck attachin' a
Label to the life we're living and imagine a
Future where we won't be living in the past
I'll be flipping birds like a chicken breast on a spatula
So if you're bragging, then you can forget it
And if it thunders and if it rains and pours, let it
And in the morning then it'll hit you that George said it
They gave him a fuck, he returned it for store credit
But don't be sore yet, if you got a score, settle it
'Cause it's more pleasure with fun before etiquette
Get up on the table and pour your drinks, get it, but
Don't be boneheaded, it's for your own benefit
I'll be getting open and seeking my seventh heaven irreverent
While you be seeking a reverend or Pope Benedict
You got a stick where the sun don't shine?
Well, that's fine, but remember that I don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
Let me tell you about my GPA, four-O, straight A's and my-
(I don't give a fuck!)
Let me tell you bout my resume. It's so cray, It's insane and my-
(I don't give a fuck!)
And my boyfriend, he's so hot, and the car that he bought me is-
(I don't give a fuck!)
And my "ooh-la-la", my "blah, blah, blah" and (I don't give a fuck!)

[Verse 2]
All I wanna do is get my mind right
If I'm looking at tomorrow, check my eyesight
All I'm gonna focus on is this fine night
'Cause all I know is that this life is finite
Never Neverland isn't more than a legend
And so I gotta be digging the present session and getting this
Wedging myself up into the wettest crevices, effortless
Grabbing a piece of the flesh, if you love it, then why fight?
Some people slower than a nineties modem
Wanna see the nips? It's a while to load 'em
If life is a woman, she's got some epic titties and I wanna get up in it and live it and motorboat 'em
'Cause I wanna see the cool and the classy
And I wanna see the cruel and the nasty
'Cause if it's real shit, lemme feel it
And if you can't deal, I don't give a fuck

[Bridge]
Let me tell you 'bout my five year plan and my 401k and-
(I don't give a fuck!)
Let me tell you 'bout my workout set, P90X and my
(I don't give a fuck!)
Let me tell you bout some random crap you don't care about and-
(I don't give a fuck!)
And my "ooh-la-la", my "blah, blah, blah" and (I don't give a fuck!)
[Chorus]
Let me tell you about my GPA, four-O, straight A's and my-
(I don't give a fuck!)
Let me tell you bout my resume. It's so cray, It's insane and my-
(I don't give a fuck!)
And my boyfriend, he's so hot, and the car that he bought me is-
(I don't give a fuck!)
And my "ooh-la-la", my "blah, blah, blah" and (I don't give a fuck!)

Difference is the Differences 

[Intro]
Hey man, you heard the new Eminem track? It's crazy!
Yeah, I heard it like six months ago, hecka long ago!
All the tracks on Chronic 2001, dude they're just crazy
Shut up, man! Let me get some hot cheetos tho!

[Hook]
Yeah you're hot
But the difference is the differences I've got
It's what I'm not
Yeah, the difference is the differences I've got
Yeah you're hot
But the difference is the differences I've got
It's what I'm not
Yeah, the difference is the differences I've got
[Verse]
Suspended the same month I won the city science fair
I won most likely to succeed and teachers nightmare
Guess I was quite scary, some hate a binary
Sent to the principals office straight from the libary
But since my voice was about as high as Mariah Carey
When I had the douchey spiky hair like Guy Fieri
My flavor was a mystery you never knew what you were getting it could be some mild or some Wild Cherry
Just read my diary, cause I'm wirey
But I'm irie, and I spit it firey, hire me
I wouldn't hurt a fly
Though sensitive you never heard me cry
But I got a certified dirty mind
So grab some turpentine, a dash of listerene
And splash my mouth out with a gallon jug of Mister Clean
I'm flashing on every asshole up in the classroom
I'm planning on coming sick I hope you had your antihistamines
Before I split the scene, and we can puff pass
Cause I'm an honor roll kid who liked to cut class
A babyface but I tend to shave with a cutlass
And If you switch the picture to HD you'll see my mustache
I tend to slow it down when they want just fast
I'm a vegetarian who thinks that PETA sucks ass
I bring the ruckus, while shmucks be kissing my tuchus, I bookishly bust it nasty, you should be rocking a dust mask
I like smoking dope, but won't pop a pill
I think Oprah's ill, but I loathe Dr. Phil
I got the propers to a topple your whole metropolis stomp an impossible obstacle I won't be stoppin' to chill
From Chapel Hill to the big apple I travel the map just trampling bastards but then I handle their hospital bill
If there's bees in the trap I'm catching em
By the thorax and abdomen
And sanding the stingers down to a rough quill
Then I dip em in ink, and I scribble a bit
But if it they wriggle then I tickle em until they hold still
Lemme say it again
In my land of pretend
I use bees as a motherfuckin' pen
But a lot of the guys I know
Have been saying that I'm so so
They're not a believer
That I'm a keeper
B-b-But I don't know
Maybe it's cause I be looking like Leave it to Beaver they're thinking that I don't flow
Even if I could be running in circles around em as if I'm gyroscope
I'll enter the draft and I'm thinking I might go pro
Running the jungle like I'm an albino rhino
Deep in the undergrowth
Fuck a disaster, bring on the asteroids
Never gonna be massacred like all of the dinos though
Bring on primal vinyl magic show
I'm turning a blind eye to the bull crap, waving bye bye
Zippity doo dah
Suck on my booty
Done with the bad luck
Put on my brass knucks
And I cold cock any Pol Pot in the whole spot, with that boom
I'm Fiddler on the Roof hitting Hitler in his fruits of the loom
I'm Jew, on the right side but it's true
I'm a Christian on the left
Side of my family crest, dude
I've been to public school and private, been unpopular and popular and I don't think people pop from a test tube

[Outro]
Difference is the differences
Difference is the differences
Yeah, the difference is the differences I've got
Difference is the differences
Difference is the differences I've got
Difference is the differences I've got
Difference is the differences I've got
Difference is the differences I've got
Difference is the differences I've got
Difference is the differences I've got
Difference is the differences I've got
Difference is the differences I've got

Gummy Bear Hundrednaire 

[Intro]
Y'all don't really know about the
About the
West side!
Y'all don't really know about the
Dirty, dirty, dirty w-w-w-w-w-west side!
I said, y'all don't really know about the
About the
So we're gon' tell you now

[Verse]
Keep it fresh like I'm Tupperware
Quailman, outside underwear
I'm the mailman, always deliver
I don't have it in my pocket, then I got it in my other pair
Baggin' saggin' Barry, slap an adversary
I'm not tan, but a lady had been sucking on my milky body
'Til my neck was, like, the only place I didn't have a hickey busting all my capillaries
I'm a human in a cyborg uniform
Find me riding on a five-horn unicorn
Five horns 'cause it got five heads
Five heads, and they all got dreads
Neon dreads, watch the braids glow
We're going dummy getting blazed on a rainbow
Blaze the rainbow, I'm so en fuego
It's great to see you on the Today Show
I'm in the future on the Day After Tomorrow Show
Smoke a fatty while you're puffing on a Marlboro
I don't have to be a billionaire
I'm a gummy bear hundrednaire stacking all the Haribo
And I got the sickest barrio
And I got the biggest heart and so
Every time I see an adorable little puppy, I know that I'm working on my cardio
I'm working on my Carter flow
I'm Atilla the Hun, I'm bucking the run of the mill, I'm a fucking gorilla
I'm coming to thrill 'em and I'm no bigger than a garden gnome
And I'm not gonna stop 'til I'm locked in a coffin
No, fuck it, I'll keep going off when dead and I'm rotten and propped up and stuffed full of cotton
[Outro]
Said, hey!
OK
Y'all don't really know about the
West, west, west, dirty
West, west, west side

A Hundred Words You Could Say Instead of Swag 

[Intro]
Swag, swag, swag, swag, swag, swag, swag, swag

[Chorus]
I thought "swag" was dead way before this
I thought "swag" had been buried in the forest
But then Bieber said "swag" in a chorus
And I went and bought a big fat thesaurus (I said)
I thought "swag" was dead way before this
I thought "swag" had been buried in the forest
But then Bieber said "swag" in a chorus
And I went and bought a big fat thesaurus
(Here's some other options)
[Verse 1]
You're a boss hog, you're a top dog
You're so slamming that I would say you've got pogs
You're suave, swell, sick
In the sense of being ill, chill, slick
You're hip, you're a hit, you're the tits, you're it
If I were being rude, then I would say you're the shhh...
Shimmy shimmy Cocoa Puffs, you're so loco
You're so dope, it's nuts, you're as raw as an open cut
You're bold, you're golden, you're funner
A stone cold stunner, a real mean mugger
You're colder than the other side of my pillow
Or hot as the underside of a cover in a Los Angeles summer
You're not dumb and dumber, you're smart and smarter
You're hard and harder, you're Peter Parker
Right after the spider bite, you're so dynamite
You're the brightest light; no, you're the hypest hype
You're so zen, you're a 10, you're a gem
You're the creme de la creme de la creme de la creme

[Spoken Interlude]
In 1860, Walt Whitman wrote "I cock my hat as I please" in his famous poem "Leaves of Grass"
In 2012, Justin Bieber said, "Swag, swag, swag on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eatin' fondue
I don't know about me, but I know about you
Say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag"

[Chorus]
I thought "swag" was dead way before this
I thought "swag" had been buried in the forest
But then Bieber said "swag" in a chorus
And I went and bought a big fat thesaurus (Say it again!)
I thought "swag" was dead way before this
I thought "swag" had been buried in the forest
But then Bieber said "swag" in a chorus
And I went and bought a big fat thesaurus
(Four, three, two, swag)

[Verse 2]
Presence, essence, pizzazz, panache, dashing, flashy, brazen and brash
The verve, the nerve, the truth, the proof, the cash, the passion and class
Better than ever, cool as a cucumber, smoother than butter, a little bit smug
Hotter than a mug, eye of the tiger, the heart of a lion, the look of a thug
Pick of the litter, the attitude, the cleanup hitter, the baddest dude
Totally sure, full of allure, a raconteur, the poison and cure
Gravitas, glamour, you're droppin' the hammer, a swashbuckling debonaire
A-lister with an X factor, a capital G with the best hair
Dragon slayer, the franchise player, the king, the president, governor, mayor
You're rare, the opposite of square and pompous, you're shaped with flair like a rhombus
Confident, jaunty, awesomely saucy, you got more props than Gandhi
Got it on lock, rocks and moxie, you're rocking some brand new socksies
From city to city, the grittiest kid, and he could be a little bit cocky
But saying "swag" is obnoxious
And if you be looking to capture the confident way that I'm walking and talking, there's options!
Just say he's got "Watsky"
[Chorus]
I thought "swag" was dead way before this (Good)
I thought "swag" had been buried in the forest (You really don't have to)
But then Bieber said "swag" in a chorus
And I went and bought a big fat thesaurus (Say it again!)
I thought "swag" was dead way before this
I thought "swag" had been buried in the forest
But then Bieber said "swag" in a chorus
And I went and bought a big fat thesaurus

[Outro]
Swag
Swaggy
Swaggity Andy
Maybe I'll climb the Swaggro Crag
Like...swagriculture
Don't get me swaggravated, though, bro
Take a— take a barrel over Ni-swag-ra Falls, feel me?
Just hella swaggy, though, all day, you know?
Son, it's just, like, it's a lifestyle, you feel me?

All I Ever Wanted 

[Intro]
DJ Nu-Mark, Cut Chemist
Thank you for the inspiration

[Verse 1]
My looks wrong, I know I sound odd
But when I hit the mic the first time, I found God
I'm not downtrodden, lack a great bod, and I be looking more like the crowd on Cape Cod
But ever since I pumped up my Reeboks, before "Fiddy" and his unit from the G block
I been rhyming in the mirror, blending in, like a diamond in the clear, trying to strut it like a peacock
I taught myself how to beat box
When I was listening to J5 and Pete Rock
2Pac and Chief Rock, you know, that we gotcha
Chillin' like a meat locker, hotter than some sriracha
Sip a bitter memory, and make an ugly face as if its nothing but some cheap vodka
Just some fuckin' mind erasers
But I'm from the bay, and we don't spend a dime on chasers
[Hook]
All I wanted to do is write rhymes
All I ever wanted to do is write rhymes
All I ever wanted to do is write rhymes
(Huh?) Is that a crime?
(What?) To write rhymes?

[Verse 2]
I don't be an economist
I don't want to be a cheap novelist
I don't want to be a weed or a botanist
I don't want to be a pimp or bottom bitch
I don't want to be a strip club manager
And I'd hate to be a strip club janitor
Mopping up for crusty ass customer, bustin' their nuts in the cuts
I just wanna bust a verse
I don't wanna be a court jester
I don't want to be a royal poison tester
I don't wanna pick up dog crap for park and rec
And I don't want to be a doghouse architect
I don't want to be a server
I don't want to flip beef burgers
Be a beat maker
A Walmart greeter
A CEO, an astronaut or a fucking sheep herder

[Hook]
All I wanted to do is write rhymes (Oough)
All I ever wanted to do is write rhymes (What?)
All I ever wanted to do is write rhymes (Okayyy!)
(Huh?) Is that a crime?
(What?) To write rhymes?

[Verse 3]
But the sad fact is, most real folks don't get don't get to practice
What we love for a living
We do backflips
And no matter where we're at on the atlas
Earth spins on its axis
It's back to the rat race
We run the hamster wheel at a mad pace
We'll run laps till our last days
Just a beast till the last rose petal drops in the glass case
I'm one of a lucky bunch
But I upchuck my free lunch when sucker punched
I'm fucking up, I don't want to free pass
When my ancestors potatoes rotted in the field they would have to eat grass
And folks put on ski masks
When their back's against the wall throwing right hooks
And I just wanna pen verses, write hooks
Man I'm such lucky asshole
Someone fucking slap me with my rhymebook
[Hook]
All I ever wanted to do
I said, all I ever wanted to do
All I ever wanted to do
Man, all I ever wanted to do

Other Cities 

[Verse 1]
There's nothin' like the feeling of the plane flight homeward;
The way my stomach dips when the landing gears lowered;
Because no matter how many miles that I wander;
The bay bridge curves like a smile on the water;
I'm like, what up missy?
Tell me you were missin' me;
With this pretty city skyline lit up like a Christmas tree;
The buildings shimmering like pinky rings from Tiffany's;
Every time I witness it I have a damn epiphany;
That this is me! This is where I've got the richest history;
Stacked with six or seven memories on every single street;
I never missed a beat;
I'm soaked in city pride;
And me oh my, this foggy sky got me misty eyed;
[Hook]
There might be other cities half as raw as ours;
(just as 'bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it)
Out in some distant galaxy among the stars;
(But I doubt it, doubt it, doubt it)

[Verse 2]
We don't play tiny violins over minor things;
We slide into the ring takin' Tyson swings;
Because this city will defend our fuckin' pride
And raise each other up like Simba in the Lion King;
We're not shy;
I ain't no coy coward;
I'll be doin' trust falls offa Coit tower;
My boys on the ground floor providin' man power;
But if I die now, mix me into clam chowder;
Put me in a bread bowl, feed me to the seagulls;
But not the freakin' tourists;
I'm sure they're peachy people;
I guess I'm just a purist;
It isn't oil, but there's somethin' in the water
And it's got me feelin' diesel;

[Hook]
There might be other cities half as raw as ours;
(just as 'bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it)
Out in some distant galaxy among the stars;
(But I doubt it, doubt it, doubt it)

[Outro: Bobby "Blue" Bland]

Ain't no love, in the heart of the city;
Ain't no love, in the heart of town;
Ain't no love, in the heart of the city;
Ain't no love, in the heart of town;
Ain't no love
Write Your Name 

[Verse 1]
Yesterday I signed my first tit
Soft with the ballpoint cause I didn't want to burst it
I did it cursive. I took my sweet time
I tried to put my personality in each line
Like I do with each rhyme
Cause in the worst case
That's what put this bust in my custody in the first place
Now I'm rounding first base, cruising cause I paid dues
Dude, I called my roommates and I gave them all the great news
They're pitiless
But so many nights up at the motel 6, tittyless
After gigs with hideously small crowds
It's been 5 years of playing colleges in small towns
I'm through with all doubt
I'm ready to bloom from wallflower
And just ball out
And live my fantasy
And if I get my name on a grammy it's for my family
But for me I just can't top the memory of my john hancock on that mammary
[Hook]
Why are we
Shy to be
Who we all would like to be?
Write your name so big and bold that the entire world can see
Although you
Can't undo
All the pain that you've been through
Write your name
Write your name
Write your name

[Verse 2]
The future's here, and it's tangible
And kind of spongy
I'm a commie but I love my fucking country right now
Just let play the fillmore and die now
I couldn't give a damn about who's raising an eyebrow
I thought I'd failed, I prayed for so long
God said "no way," but I'm all like, 'come oooon'
And he's all like "okay"
And at first I'm all like "don't play"
But then I'm all like "hooray!"
And I grabbed that baton
And ran like a Cavs fan, away from Lebron
Now they gab about me in banks and salons
And they're mad to admit it, but pale kid's the bomb
From anonymous geek
To Don Juan in a week
And I'm calm
But if ever I seem gloomy
I can't stress enough how much this means to me
I held the tears in, cause I didn't dare to dream
Of the most beauteous boobie I've ever seen

[Hook]
Why are we
Shy to be
Who we all would like to be?
Write your name so big and bold that the entire world can see
Although you
Can't undo
All the pain that you've been through
Write your name
Write your name
Write your name

Why are we
Shy to be
Who we all would like to be?
Write your name so big and bold that the entire world can see
Although you
Can't undo
All the pain that you've been through
Write your name
Write your name
Write your name

[Outro]
Right now, on my command
Say the world is a booby in the palm of my hand
Everybody say right now, on my command
The world is a booby in the palm of my hand
(Na na na na na na na na na)

Stupidass 

[Chorus]
If I could go back then (Back then)
If I could go back when (Back when)
And step into the past (Way back)
I'd do it all again (Again)
If I could go back then (Back then)
If I could go back when (Back when)
I was a stupidass (Dumbass)
I'd do it all again (Again)

[Verse 1]
I might have a weak chin, but I don't have a glass jaw
So watch your fist glance off my cheek skin and back off
I cut my teeth on the blacktop, I'm used to something cruel
'Cause in my youth, my tooths were crowded as the public schools
Where we moved above the rules, where the currency was percocets
Where I showed up early rocking headgear and turtlenecks
This nerd'll flex and you won't see this man pout
'Cause the traits that got us beat down are what make us stand out
So let your tongue hang out if you got lips like Mick Jagger
Plant and stand proud with that little kid swagger
The subtle it factor on the baddest individuals
'Cause adamant originals don't end up in pigeonholes
Which gets my thinking it's a damn shame dorks
Don't pop their pimples like they're champagne corks
I work the quirks, 'cause if I didn't start sloppily
I'd never clean up this Goddamn properly
[Chorus]
If I could go back then (Back then)
If I could go back when (Back when)
And step into the past (Way back)
I'd do it all again (Again)
If I could go back then (Back then)
If I could go back when (Back when)
I was a stupidass (Dumbass)
I'd do it all again (Again)

[Verse 2]
I never threw like Elway, or overthrew like El Che
So I moved to LA, to the land of milk and self-hate
But one day, I'll strip and then strut buck down the Sunset Strip as it was a runway
I'm thinking maybe Sunday
And if you need sensei for sexy, just text me
I stay by San Vicente and La Brea where the rent's cheap
So you can't tempt me with a Beamer, Benz or Bentley
That's complete with penis envy, and even keyless entry
'Cause see, I'm making ends meet, so care to be friendly
And make ends meet, in my backseat in an awkward frenzy?
Once in a parking lot while practicing anatomy
I was knocking elbows 'till the music zapped the battery
And dammit, it was bad, but I'm not mad I brought my A game
Even if we sat there naked ‘til the man from Triple A came
And it was way lame, but I've got on good authority
She boldly told the sordid story to her whole sorority

[Chorus]
If I could go back then (Back then)
If I could go back when (Back when)
And step into the past (Way back)
I'd do it all again (Again)
If I could go back then (Back then)
If I could go back when (Back when)
I was a stupidass (Dumbass)
I'd do it all again (Again)

[Verse 3]
Some days I wake up and I wonder, "What would Buddha do?"
And then I jump into my fruity little Subaru
Some dudes'll front, "How do you do, Mama?"
Because some women see the mula, and say "Ooh la-la"
But I say "Woo-sah"
I don't smooch on muchachas who need mucha to mooch off
I'm cool for, like, a futon out in Utah, a yurt up in the Yukon
When hurtin', I'll go back to herding wild yaks in Bhutan or cop a coupe with coupons
But when you get a FUPA like a dugong
I'll treat you supa dupa, we can't do wrong
'Cause beauty is a dude who puts the moves on, then moves on
We're all moving as true pawns
Get chewed in the food chain, we're all nude in the new dawn
Brain screwed on with a plain birthday suit on
Let's graduate, human, summa kumbayah, huge honors
So you goners should do the do and do wander the blue yonder
'Cause trying to fool the future takes too long

Bucketlist 

TO BE INTRO
So much to do
So much to see
So much for you
So much for me
So much to do and see
So much for you and me

Verse
When I'm thirty five I'll learn to work a potter's wheel
When I'm forty I'll forty go streaking at a soccerfield
And if they try to tackle me then I'll distract em flapping my arms and happily shrieking like a coccatiel
When I'm sixty I'll get really really fat
And then go back to skinny really really fast
And then go skydiving with no parachute and glide around like I'm a flying squirrel with my skinflaps
Like a creepy Aladdin (Just need my Jasmine)
Cause there's no feat you can't achieve if you believe it can happen
If yesterday's a pain in the ass
Tomorrow's an aspirin
And you might be feeling better than you ever could imagine
At seventy I'll rock sandals with black socks
When I'm eighty I'll try heroin or crack rocks
Or both-- And mix em in a smoothie
I'll be old and toothless
And I'll be feeling groovy
I'll make out with school teachers
Chill at nude beaches
And free the zoo creatures
And if they tell me it's a issue for my health
I'll tell em bitch I'm ninety you can kindly fuck yourself
I'm just being really really really really really really really real right now
And so I just plan on doing what I really really really really feel like now
VERSE 2
I probably won't bang all the girls I liked in high school
Although that would be quite cool
But I'll list their names out on some wide rule
Paper
And I'll call each one of them and tell them that I really would have liked to love em
Back in the day
Not to be a creeper obviously
Just to see who'd respond positively
And just take it from there
We'll just take it from there
I hope you answer my prayers
Cause
We don't know what the future holds
Wounded Healer 

[Verse 1]
His footprints are fading away from the beach
We're not a family to pray or to preach
But daddy's best friend took a handful of pills and now he's at a podium making a speech
Yesterday night after dark
He carefully wrote his remarks
But everyone said what he put on his page so he threw it way and went straight from the heart

[Hook]
I thought this was a party
But all my friends are leaving
And I still want to play
You wrecked me when you stepped out
Cause you're the wounded healer
And you're supposed to stay
[Verse 2]
A year's a bottle in a bucket of trash
It'll tip over the more that it stacks
Didn't notice it till now
But dad's been moving slower every time we go play catch
I'm scared of the day when he'll carry a cane
I carry his dream, I carry his name
And when papa is gone he will never be gone
Because the sound of our sneeze is the same
So, God bless, I hear your voice in mine
And I wanna stop time like a carnival ride, because
I don't know what I'm saying, but I mean it
I don't know what I'm saying, but I mean it
I don't know what I'm saying, but I mean it
I don't know what I'm saying, but I mean it
I mean it, said
I thought this was a party

(Harmonica solo)

[Hook]
I thought this was a party
But all my friends are leaving
And I still want to play
You wrecked me when you stepped out
Cause you're the wounded healer
And you're supposed to stay
Nothing Like the First Time 

The first time I ate avocado was so amazing that I came

And that was the first time that I came so the only thing I could compare it to is the taste of avocado. Almost the same

The first time I got high, I ran into my friend’s bedroom and I hung onto each corner of the mattress because I knew that I would be flung into space if I didn’t hold tight

Two years before that I went to my first concert. I was high all night. And the first time someone clapped for me on stage I floated three inches off the pavement walking home

Only one girl has ever really wrapped my stomach into pretzels. She didn’t give me butterflies. She gave me pterodactyls
I’m talking terrible internal bruising and the first time I kissed her was like the first time I saw fireworks, which was like the sky first kissing me in the eyeballs
In high school the self-defense counselor taught us that to defend ourselves against a rapist, by sticking a thumb into the corner of his eye socket and popping it out like a grape
Babe, for the chance to be with you, I would pop my own eyeballs out and say, "Here. I only have eyes for you."
So everywhere you went you’d carry me around in your pocket and every time you pulled out a handful of loose change I’d get to wink at you and a thousand miles away you would think of how charming I am— me— weaving blindly through LA traffic. You— in some bullshit other place

But you shouldn’t leave first times until the end of summer
Because you went off to college, years passed, and I realized I was the only one calling anymore
And that first kiss hardened into the last. My love : retarded, preserved, a pterodactyl in a tar pit, the music over before it started, a lost guitar pick
I’ve stopped trying to match it, searching for that magical attachment

Because marriages are not fucking Disney
Bad marriages are sandcastles
Good marriages are McDonald’s hamburgers
You can leave a good marriage on a plate in the sun for fifty years and it stays pretty much the same

They key, I hear, is to fight routine— to make the smallest moments gleam and mean something

And if you ever feel yourself fading, face paint your old and aging creased-up cheeks gold-plated with a jar of first-time and if you need a youthful spruce-up just grab a tube of that newb juice and lube up and if you’re hurting just rub the good stuff where you’re burning

But a word of warning
The first time tends to make the bad times worse
There’s the rub
It doesn’t make things better, just louder
It amplifies a murmur ... er-er
Great is greater. Greater is greaterer. And broke ...is broker. And bone... is boner
It’s not a perfect formula
But the first time that I kissed you, the door of your crappy Civic already half-open, you said "I’m glad you did that."
And I have a feeling that, for you, it wasn’t a first-time
It was a "this one time."
But I will remember that moment for the rest of my life, even if I have to arm wrestle Alzheimer's for it

And if I ever get a chance to kiss you again, you know, a second time, I'm gonna stick my tongue out and lick you right across your face. Because I’ve already kissed you. But I never licked you
And you’ll say, "Ugh. Why did you do that?" And I’ll say, "Hey sexy. Did someone slap you across the face with a banana slug or is that a big shiny trail of first-time on your cheek. Maybe we can go back to my place and gets some first-time on the sheets."

It’s worth it
After all, there’s nothing like the first time
The first time’s always perfect

$$

[Verse 1]
My head's up in the sky it's higher than the clouds are
I like to look up at the stars and wonder how far?
From what I hear, about a billion babies are delivered
Everyday and so it's like the planet is a clown car
I know it probably shouldn't work, but we all fit
Like a Micky D's Play Place ball pit.
So look at me! I'm about to jump up in it
And be swimming through syringes like a motherfucking dolphin
I could have an outburst. There's a lot of freaky people
On the planet and it makes me want to crowd surf
Everybody, everywhere dig downwards
That's what we work for. Party at the Earth's core
Don't know where to go to go far
But if I go then I know I should go hard
And if I go and I never come back
Then I'll send a post card and a couple thumb tacks
[Hook]
Said I'm looking...
I'm looking...
I'm looking for energy everywhere
I'm looking...
I'm looking...
I'm looking for energy

[Verse 2]
Teacher said this party started with a loud bang
The waymy ears are ringing I don't hear sound, man
I'm steady looking at the crowd like a proud dad
For coming out instead of clicking on a mouse pad
Steal a bounce-house. Fill it full of helium
Ride it like a blimp. I think that it'd be really fun
To do a triple flip in zero gravity
While puffing on a Philly blunt and shooting stars with a BB gun
Tonight I'm looking at something that I've never seen before
I might even paint graffiti on a meteor
Cause I can reach it, homie. Veni vidi vici
It's all peachy, got a vision of the future on a Ouija board
Didn't believe it I, though it was CGI
Why don't you decide, if we're computerized?
Assuming you and I - are alive
And tomorrow is the rapture I wonder what you want to do tonight

[Hook]

I don't wanna. I don't wanna. I don't wanna. I don't wanna
I don't wanna end up as an anybody-everybody
Isn't anybody made of arteries and antibodies
And you never get to see confetti without getting bloody
If you read ahead, you'd all be surprised
Spoiler alert – we're all going to die
But I'll be hooping in the drive way in the clouds
Shooting fouls with that big orange ball in the sky
When I die. When I say 'well I made it', I'll be way
Celebrated, or remain as a staple
If I stay hella faded, then I'll fade, and my fate will be the same
As the fakers with the chains on the labels
Shame people do it for the fame and the cash
Not the flame and the passion. I train through the pain
And I frame every passage as a way to stay fit
Cause an 808 kick is my Gatorade drink

Cardboard Castles
Fireworks

[Verse 1]
It’s hard to be living
You gotta play the cards you were given
You think it’s simple but it goddamn isn’t
It’s tougher now than breaking out of Shawshank prison
And as you’re hittin your prime
People say you been committing a crime
But I won’t quit till I’m home
I’ll chip the limestone a bit at a time
Wait! I’m a pale ass pale middle-class straight white male
I won’t have an alibi the day I fail
Cause if I ever went to jail, Mom would pay my bail
In a [boom-boom] heartbeat
Mom and Dad have given me a lot more than a pat on the back
And I gotta thank ‘em for loving me
From the moment I was strapped in a Volvo car seat
When I needed a pep talk
I couldn’t remember to wreck shop
Writer’s block, staring at my laptop desktop
Or sleeping in my rental in a turnpike rest stop
Shit in storage, living from a suitcase
Thinking “this is how a silver spoon tastes?”
Cause you can make a dream possible
But it’ll never be easy, no matter what you chase
If you wanna poke fun then do so
I’ll do it for you, it’s no crime
I’m like if the dude from Juno grew a Jewfro and liked to rhyme [OOoooooohhh!!!]
So tell me that I’m not a rapper
Tell Rudolph he can’t pull sleighs
Tell Pluto it’s not a planet
And he’ll probably keep spinning in the same old way
On and on, every day
Right around the sun, wanna feel the rays
You do it ‘cause you love it like nothing else in the universe
And fuck it, it’s embedded in your DNA

[Outro Skit]
Boom! It was really loud. I mean, seriously loud. Boom! Boom! Boom!
Were you scared?
I'm probably like... I'm probably like the one who was getting scared like... Ten times... more often... Then anybody else I know!
I think people that say that they're not scared are lying about not being scared
Yeah... So is people saying that they're not ticklish


Strong As An Oak

[Chorus]
Everything is A-OK (yep)
Because I’m strong as an O-A-K (an Oak!)
But money don’t grow on trees
And I’m B-R-O-K-E (Broke!)
Everything is A-OK (yep)
Because I’m strong as an O-A-K (an Oak!)
But money don’t grow on trees
And I’m B-R-O-K-E (I'm fucking broke y'all!)

[Verse 1]
Them rims them rings them things, you can bring ‘em out
I just had my debit card declined at In-N-Out
The line is flipping out, giving me evil eyes
Fuck the soda, re-run it with just the cheesy fries
‘Cause I don’t think money is THE devil
I’m not sinking, I’m just kicking it at sea level
I got my floaties on
I’m focusing on all the wonderful stuff with the force of Obi Wan
Kenobi bro, I’m broke although I won’t be woebegone
‘Cause even though my bank account is low or overdrawn
I’m down to mow yer lawn
I’m getting open I’m soaking up every moment
And so we should make a toast we won’t be sober till the BROKE of dawn
Because beer is cheap
And because love is free
I’m buzzin’ feeling like every friend is a cousin, G
And someday we’ll be reminiscing on some wasn’t we
Just so down and out
But we were happy then ‘cause…

[Chorus]
Everything is A-OK (yep)
Because I’m strong as an O-A-K (an Oak!)
But money don’t grow on trees
And I’m B-R-O-K-E (Broke!)
Everything is A-OK (yep)
Because I’m strong as an O-A-K (an Oak!)
But money don’t grow on trees
And I’m B-R-O-K-E (Broke!)

[Verse 2]
Why should I sit on my ass on the couch and be asking why life isn’t equal?
With lesser possessions I’m light as a feather and so I can fly like an eagle
‘Cause everyone dies and I wonder why leaders in power would lie to their people
Be planning like they could be fitting a camel up into the eye of a needle
But dammit I’d settle for fitting a 94 Camry inside of my driveway
I’m sick of the image I’m living my life and I’m doing it my way
I’d rather be making the choices I’m proud of than chasing a mountain of money
But if that mountain comes to me, I’m climbing it
Got a brick and I’m laying it down
Got a shovel, I’m breaking this ground
Because I’m in the red, but it’s only a color that I will be painting this town
Because when I make it then I dedicate it to the friends I stayed with
Who would do me favors even lend me paper when I couldn’t pay for a little takeout
And to the fact
That whatever you think that it means
I be here and I’m living my dreams
And it’s ‘cause of the people I leaned on when I came apart at the seams
So gimme the moon
And gimme the spoon
I’m licking it clean
Until there just ain’t nothing left
But who would lend a hand ‘cause…

[Bridge]
Everything’s A-O
Everything’s A-O
So when I say Day-O
You say Everything’s A-O

[Chorus]
Everything is A-OK (yep)
Because I’m strong as an O-A-K (an Oak!)
But money don’t grow on trees
And I’m B-R-O-K-E (Broke!)
Everything is A-OK (yep)
Because I’m strong as an O-A-K (an Oak!)
But money don’t grow on trees
And I’m B-R-O-K-E (Broke!)
Everything is A-OK (yep)
Because I’m strong as an O-A-K (an Oak!)
But money don’t grow on trees
And I’m B-R-O-K-E (Broke!)
Everything is A-OK (yep)
Because I’m strong as an O-A-K (an Oak!)
But money don’t grow on trees
And I’m B-R-O-K-E (Broke!)


Moral of the Story

[Hook]
And the moral of the story is
And the moral of the story is
(Work!) till your arms fall off
Till your abs get hard and your bone’s all soft
(Just WORK!) till your hands go numb
And they cramp and the fans in the stands go dumb

[Verse 1]
I write till my fingers look like a bouquet of roses
You gotta bring yourself your flowers now in show biz
Focus it’s Quiet Coyote come on let’s go kids
Everybody get together with a study buddy
And then talk about the fucks that I don’t give
Because it’s so big and explosive
But a lotta people don’t live, they don’t ever get a motive
If you got a goal you gotta hold onto what hope is
If I didn’t have it I would ask you where the rope is
Work is my church and so the studio’s the closest
I spit it sick until my cootie flow’s the grossest
Don’t be so pissed just be focused on your own shit
‘Cause we Supercalifornialisticsexyandweknowsit
You’re not my menace, I go for number one, not a top five finish
You can have a chicken pot pie
But I’m thinking that I’m gonna have another can of Popeye’s spinach
I’m a Rottweiler, pop my collar when I pop my fur
You’re on my nerves, mark my words
Gotta put a leg up and then mark my turf

[Hook]
And the moral of the story is
And the moral of the story is
(Work!) till your arms fall off
Till your abs get hard and your bone’s all soft
(Just WORK!) till your hands go numb
And they cramp and the fans in the stands go dumb

[Verse 2]
Work until I’m black and yellow black and yellow, worker bee
I just work until I’m black and blue and burgundy
Burgundy, work until I earn that rich mahogany
Honestly, can’t you tell I’m working, bitch don’t bother me
Show some modesty, if you’re watching me
A bitch is anybody in my way it’s not misogyny
But if you're blockin’ me I will soon defeat you
I will build a bridge above you, or I’ll tunnel underneath you
I will eat you and excrete you and I’ll feed you to the flowers
If I need to I’ll go through you and absorb your fucking powers
I put in hour after hour let’s be crystal clear
I’m gonna get there if it takes a day or fifty years
I’ll fingerbang my fears, I’ll fucking punch a dragon
Even with the Himalayas in my way it’s gonna happen
‘Cause waiting doesn’t work, and praying may not come through
And hoping doesn’t work. So I will be the one to (work)

[Hook]
And the moral of the story is
And the moral of the story is
(Work!) till your arms fall off
Till your abs get hard and your bone’s all soft
(Just WORK!) till your hands go numb
And they cramp and the fans in the stands go dumb

[Outro]
And maybe someday you might see me in a glossy photo
No weirdo’s rocked the bells as hard as me since Quasimodo


Ugly Faces

What's up, Beatrice?
I just called you Beatrice
And I don't
And I don't
And I don't care if that is your name
Back in the day
Daddy would say
That if I kept on making ugly faces
And I wasn't careful it'd stay that way
Oh great
Wow, no shit
Ooh, hooray, that's so sick
With a little bit of luck maybe one of those sticks
I'll be feeling a hella of a lot of swell
And from the second that I step in I'll be smelling like a big cheese
Everybody better be ready to get it get it
Cause I'm getting nekkid if you really want a strip tease
And the babies in their highchairs taking off their bibs
And their mommies all be ripping out their wig weaves
And the pretty people in the oil paintings on the wall
Are popping molly and they're stripping off their fig leaves
Better burn your clothes
It'll curl your toes
Kissing women and they turn to toads
I'm pimping Kermit's hoes
And I'm sure that every girl is a pearl
And the world is a perfect globe
But when I'm joking with my little cousin
And he pulls my finger then the motherfuckin' earth explodes
Boom
Sorry, not sorry
Sorry, not sorry
Sorry, not sorry
Sorry, not sorry
Sorry, not sorry
Sorry, not sorry
Sorry
Not sorry
Back in the day
Daddy would say
That if I kept on making ugly faces
And I wasn't careful it'd stay that way
Oh great
Wow, no shit
Ooh, hooray, that's so sick
With a little bit of luck maybe one of those sticks
Everybody been in it to win it kickin' in for
A minute and chilling but you're tardy it's why
I gotta kill it and then hit the pretty
People in the building with my party trick
I think I'm gonna walk out of the door
Hop in my DeLorean and I'm gonna soar
'Cept that it's a Subaru, and I'm yelling hoodie hoo
Hanging out the window like I'm Marty McFly
A lot of the chickens in the flock wanna squawk and they get obnoxious
And all I hear is bawk bawk
And I'm not gonna wanna talk shop
Better put a sock in it if you gotta cock block
And be toxic and knock us and all we
Wanna do is rock rock and be raucous
I'm not gonna ever stop if you
Think I'm chopped liver in the crock pot
Cause I am a boss hog and I want the top spot and I got this
Sorry, not sorry
Sorry, not sorry
Sorry, not sorry
Sorry, not sorry
Sorry, not sorry
Sorry, not sorry
Sorry
Not sorry
Back in the day
Daddy would say
That if I kept on making ugly faces
And I wasn't careful it'd stay that way
Oh great
Wow, no shit
Ooh, hooray, that's so sick
With a little bit of luck maybe one of those sticks


Skit #1

[Verse]
"There's like only one bully in my class
He just thinks he's all cool, he thinks he's smarter than me
He thinks a lot of things!
You know, you know Brazilian ju jitsu right?
A self defense class?"
"Hey talk quiet though so they don't hear us."
"You know Brazilian ju jitsu class right? Self defense?"
"Yeah"
"Well guess what, I'm taking them and-
And after a while, he's gonna get his surprise attack
He's really gonna get it
Oh I'll tell you he's really gonna get a surprise attack
He won't even expect it!"


Kill a Hipster

Rent's up (that shit's no good)
Starbucks where the skate rink stood
It's a fixture (it does no good)
(I know) kill a hipster (save your hood)
Wrote congress (it did no good)
Read scripture (it did no good)
You could take a picture or knock on wood
(Fuck that) kill a hipster (save your hood)
I'm getting Hummus, hummus
I'm getting hummus, hummus
I'm at the park playing dodgeball
Drinking San Pellegrino like it's Cristal
No school, alcohol
Living no rules, Calvinball
You wanna brawl? Ho please
I sprinkle you with some goat cheese
I get it straight from the fuckin' farm
I even put goat cheese in my lucky charms
I'm at the taco truck looking like a Mack
I roll my Rs hard like I'm busting off a gat
It's like, "Hola mama, I'm your papa"
May I please have dos Horchatas?
I'm like brap brap brap
When I smack your ass fast with my backpack strap
Rent's up (that shit's no good)
Starbucks where the skate rink stood
It's a fixture (it does no good)
(I know) kill a hipster (save your hood)
Wrote congress (it did no good)
Read scripture (it did no good)
You could take a picture or knock on wood
(Fuck that) kill a hipster (save your hood)
Pencil to the neck, razor to your inner tube
Bullet to your disrespect, I hate your hipster attitude
Your whole chassez, acting like you own us with your whole passe
Dance around the issue patna, no plie
But you'll get broke for that French shit, so casse
And you can put that in your lit mag and your Tumblr blog
Eat it with the bacon off your farm fresh hog
Sip it like Kombucha, hope your last meal suit ya
Do-gooder types, commuters on bikes
Brooding 20-somethings with the coolest of "likes"
You be loving on my city like Johns
Rubbing on her titties leaving money in palms
Our rumbling guts can only hunger so much
Plus we redundantly blunted in lieu of giving a fuck
We'll cut you for the scratch
Leave in on a tee
And if we've done it properly you're copping it from Treat, 'cause
Rent's up (that shit's no good)
Starbucks where the skate rink stood
It's a fixture (it does no good)
(I know) kill a hipster (save your hood)
Wrote congress (it did no good)
Read scripture (it did no good)
You could take a picture or knock on wood
(Fuck that) kill a hipster (save your hood)
Look in the mirror and it's clear I've become one of 'em
Kill me please if I'm one of 'em
I walk the block like I'm hot shit
I gentrified the corner store just buying hot chips
But now I'm caught red-handed
With this land so make me a dead bandit
And if you see me sipping at an open keg
Put me down like a horse with a broken leg
Rent's up (that shit's no good)
Starbucks where the skate rink stood
It's a fixture (it does no good)
(I know) kill a hipster (save your hood)
Wrote congress (it did no good)
Read scripture (it did no good)
You could take a picture or knock on wood
(Fuck that) kill a hipster (save your hood)

Hey, Asshole

Hey, asshole
See the sun is shining
But you are not smiling
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
I'm an asshole
'Cause the sun is shining
But I am not smiling
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
I know I'm often told
That there's a pot of gold
But I don't see no fucking rainbow and my coffee's cold
I know I should be grateful
I know I'm good and able
But I don't have the strength to get up from the kitchen table
This kind of shot comes once
Another opportunity of a lifetime just slipped away
And that's the fifth this month
But when you take a punch
Don't you ever forget
Why you get up and you put one foot in front of the next
Got the power of my will
I don't wanna win a mil
But I'm looking at window sill
Gotta take a bitter pill
Gonna pay for what I did to my head and my heart'll foot the bill
Got a foot in my mouth and because I'm kicking myself I developed
A habit of knocking out my front tooth
Looking uncouth
Want to hear the truth
Give it to me straight
151 proof
Telling myself it'll happen when I'm happy
But I'm climbing up a ladder that has got no end
Hung up on a rung I'll never make it to the top
I'm looking at the bottom and I must descend
All I want to do is buck this trend
Everybody need a buck to spend
And I'll be working on myself, 'til I work on someone else
'Til I get there Ima just pretend
I know I'm often told
That there's a pot of gold
But I don't see no fucking rainbow and my coffee's cold
I know I should be grateful
I know I'm good and able
But I don't have the strength to get up from the kitchen table
This kind of shot comes once
Another opportunity of a lifetime just slipped away
And that's the fifth this month
But when you take a punch
Don't you ever forget
Why you get up and you put one foot in front of the next
Hey, asshole
See the sun is shining
But you are not smiling
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
I'm an asshole
'Cause the sun is shining
But I am not smiling
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
When I'm in a crisis
In a moment of silence
I look under my eyelids
And I'm checking my mileage
I been using a pool of water as a mirror but not for style it's
So I can reach in and pimp slap my reflection for acting childish
Spent a half an hour sitting at the bottom of my shower
Lettin' the water run over my body and dammit I wanted to get up
But I didn't have the power
I don't have the answers anyway yay (yay, yay, yay)
Don't want to panic but I gotta come clean
Because the plan of the planet is just mean
Knew it was tough, but dammit it's obscene
I've been huffing and puffing up to the top of the summit
And I'ma rough it if I have enough steam
I'll keep on coming and coming until I'm coming with the stamina of a salmon
Who's heading upstream (nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
Hey, asshole
See the sun is shining
But you are not smiling
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
I'm an asshole
'Cause the sun is shining
But I am not smiling
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
And I don't know why


All I Need is One

One tape in the deck
One way to connect (all I need is one)
One moment alone
One reason to roam
One place I call home (all I need is one)
One tick on the clock
One trick up my sleeve
One thing to believe (all I need is one)
One person to love
One verse and one prayer
For one person who cares (all I need is one)
So put one hand in the air
It used to be I’d get afraid and I’d drive
Going forward’s always been the only place I can hide
With no direction I would speed a hundred miles down the coast
Until I lose the ghost that’s chasing me but never arrive
I know the night’s scary, but we’re alive and the pipe’s cherry
And I’ve got a stack of papers like a library
I’m driving seeking a beacon of light freakishly
All I needed was a speaker that might speak to me
But my CD system is so janky a cone dangles
And it dances on its chord like it’s Bo Jangles
You can work it if you hold it at a low angle
But when the bass hits it grows tangled
Come on right speaker! I’ll take everything you give me
But don’t pity me, there’s people living on a single kidney
In my shitty car I’m living large and mashing through my city
Sitting pretty I know
That I’m ready to go
One tape in the deck
One way to connect (all I need is one)
One moment alone
One reason to roam
One place I call home (all I need is one)
One tick on the clock
One trick up my sleeve
One thing to believe (all I need is one)
One person to love
One verse and one prayer
For one person who cares (all I need is one)
So put one hand in the air
For beautiful babies in Vegas on their last chip
For all my ninth life kittens hittin’ catnip
For heavy drinkers thinking they were never jack shit
You’re thinking that’s it, but hit a backflip
You got a cracked rib or, maybe a bad liver
You got a bad hip or even a bad temper
But if it’s last supper, one legged mad leper
Put on that glass slipper, you ain’t no half stepper
This ain’t no last breath, it’s only one collapsed lung
We’re holding up the bank with nothing but a cap gun
Down to your last blank
Down to my last drop
Up in the gas tank
We better have fun
Time isn’t a sacred cow
And I’m willing to take it down to the final minute or second, milking my last one
Going up for a take and I’m itching for action
All I need is one
I should remind myself that
All I need is one
One tape in the deck
One way to connect (all I need is one)
One moment alone
One reason to roam
One place I call home (all I need is one)
One tick on the clock
One trick up my sleeve
One thing to believe (all I need is one)
One person to love
One verse and one prayer
For one person who cares (all I need is one)
So put one hand in the air


Tiny Glowing Screens Part 1

And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens, glowing screens
And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens
I’ve seen a person go to shows and raise a lighter app
But if you’re at my concert please don’t ever try that crap
Let’s set fire to the heavens
Turn the motherfucking speakers to 11, this is Spinal Tap
The future might defeat me, the internet can eat me
It really tastes like chicken when I bite the hand that feeds me
And I say me me, me me, play my CD, CD
Yes indeedy deedy
We be greedy and it’s tragic that we yawn
We got every gadget but don’t care there’s magic in our palm
‘Cause it’s been getting so hot, I can feel the slow rot
But let’s not die before we get to fuck a robot
Because we all need something to live for, something to live for, something to live for
We all need something to live for, something to live for
And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens, glowing screens
And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens
There was a time before the pot really got strong
Before the hippies got jobs talking long, long
Before the people talked in English out in Hong Kong
Before the holy Dalai Lama had a dot com
Before God’s dad got it on with God’s mom
Before he made us pretty things on which to drop bombs
Before the war crimes
The rich and poor times
I’m talking in the land before The Land Before Time
But then the planet lost its baby fat and got crazy
And we’ve been acting like some fraidycats a lot lately
Something’ll kill us like cigarettes or the commies maybe
Or maybe AIDS or scabies, rabies or zombie babies
Even the KGB, pray we be free from ADD, wade in and bathe in Hades
No army or Navy’s saving me
And I can’t tell our little victories from epic fails
It’s either heaven or hell and I can’t make heads or tails
Are we useless?
No excuses
We took the peace sign, reduced it to deuces
And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens, glowing screens
And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens


Tiny GLowing Screens Part 2

There’s 7 billion 46 million people on the planet
And most of us have the audacity to think we matter
Hey, you hear the one about the comedian who croaked?
Someone stabbed him in the heart, just a little poke
But he keeled over ‘cause he went into battle wearing chain mail made of jokes
Hey, you hear the one about the screenwriter who passed away?
He was giving elevator pitches and the elevator got stuck halfway
He ended up eating smushed sandwiches they pushed through a crack in the door
And repeating the same crappy screenplay idea about talking dogs 'til his last day
Hey, you hear the one about the fisherman who passed?
He didn’t jump off that ledge
He just stepped out into the air and pulled the ground up towards him really fast
Like he was pitching a line and went fishing for concrete
The earth is a drum and he’s hitting it on beat
The reason there’s smog in Los Angeles is ‘cause if we could see the stars
If we could see the context of the universe in which we exist
And we could see how small each one of us is
Against the vastness of what we don’t know
No one would ever audition for a McDonalds commercial again
And then where would we be?
No frozen dinners and no TV
And is that a world we want to text in?
Either someone just microwaved popcorn
Or I hear the sound of a thousand people pulling their heads out of their asses in rapid succession
The people are hunched over in Boston
They’re starting app stores and screen printing companies in San Francisco
They’re grinning in Los Angeles like they’ve got fishhooks in the corners of their mouth
But don’t paint me like the good guy ‘cause every time I write
I get to choose the angle that you view me and select the nicest light
You wouldn’t respect me if you heard the typewriter chatter tap tap
Tapping through my mind at night
The same stupid tape loop of old sitcom dialogue
And tattered memories of a girl I got to grind on in high school
Filed carefully on rice paper
My heart is a colored pencil
But my brain is an eraser
I don’t want a real girl, I want to trace her from a catalogue
Truth be told I’m unlikely to hold you down
'Cause my soul is a crowded subway train
And people keep deciding to get on the next one that rolls through town
I’m joining a false movement in San Francisco
I’m frowning and hunched over in Boston
I’m smiling in Los Angeles like I’ve got fishhooks in the corners of my mouth
And I’m celebrating on weekends
Because there are 7 billion 47 million people on the planet
And I have the audacity to think I matter
I know it’s a lie but I prefer it to the alternative
Because I’ve got a tourniquet tied at my elbow / I’ve got
A blunt wrap filled with compliments and I’m burnin it
You say to go to sleep but I been bouncing off my bedroom walls since I was hecka small
We’re every age at once and tucked inside ourselves like Russian nesting dolls
My mother is an 8 year old girl
My grandson is a 74 year old retiree whose kidneys just failed
And that’s the glue between me and you
That’s the screws and nails
We live in a house made of each other
And if that sounds strange that’s because it is
Someone please freeze time so I can run around turning everyone’s pockets inside out
And remember, you didn’t see shit



Sloppy Seconds

[Verse 1]
Fuck you if you love a car for its paint job
Love you if you love a car for the road trips
Show me the miles and your arms and the pink scar
Where the doctor had to pull out all the bone chips
'Cause you were pressing on the gas just a bit hard
Right in the moment where the road curved a bit sharp
And when you woke up
Somebody was unclipping your seat belt
And pulling you from the open window of your flipped car

[Chorus]
Cold pizza, tie-dye shirts
Broken hearts, give'm here, give'm here
Hand me downs, give me give me leftovers
Give me give me sloppy seconds
Give em here, give em here

[Refrain]
I don't care where you've been
How many miles, I still love you
I don't care where you've been
How many miles, I still love you

[Verse 2]
Show me someone who says they got no baggage
I'll show you somebody whose got no story
Nothing gory means no glory, but baby please don't bore me
We won't know until we get there
The who, or the what, or the when where
My favorite sweater was a present that I got a couple presidents ago
And I promised that I would rock it till it's thread bare
Bet on it
Every single person gotta couple skeletons
So pretty soon, in this room
It'll just be me and you when we clear out all the elephants
Me and you and the elements
We all have our pitfalls
Beer's flat, the cabs have been called
And everybody and their momma can hear the drama that's happening behind these thin walls

[Chorus: Watsky & Myrtle Gunderson & Both]
Cold pizza
Tie-dye shirts (Tie-dye shirts)
Broken hearts
Give'm here, give'm here
Hand me downs (Hand me downs)
Leftovers (Leftovers)
Sloppy seconds
Give'm here, give'm here

[Refrain: Watsky with Myrtle Gunderson]
I don't care where you've been
How many miles, I still love you
I don't care where you've been
How many miles, I still love you

[Post-Chorus: Watsky with Myrtle Gunderson & Watsky]
I don't care (Cold pizza)
Where you've been (Tie-dye shirts)
How many (Broken hearts) miles, I still love you
I don't care (Hand me downs)
Where you've been (Leftovers)
How many (Sloppy seconds) miles, I still love you

[Verse 3]
My pattern with women isn't a flattering image
But I don't want to run away because I said so
I dont want to be the guy to hide all of my flaws
And I'll be giving you the side of me that I don't let show
Everything in fashion
That has ever happened
Always coming crashing down
Better let go
But in a couple years it will be retro
You rock Marc Ecko
My shirts have the gecko
'Cause in the past man, I was hopeless
But now's when my little cousins look the dopest
(Whoop whoop)
Fuck the fashion po-po
Have a stale doughnut, I don't need no tips
Fuck a five second rule
That's a plan I never understood
It's September in my kitchen in a Christmas sweater
Sipping cold coffee on the phone with damaged goods
[Bridge: Watsky with Myrtle Gunderson]
And there is not a single place that I would rather be
I'm fucked up just like you are, and you're fucked up just like me

[Chorus: Watsky & Myrtle Gunderson & Both]
Cold pizza (Cold pizza)
Tie-dye shirts (Tie-dye shirts)
Broken hearts
Give'm here, give'm here
Hand me downs (Oh, hand me downs!)
Give me give me leftovers (Leftovers!)
Give me give me sloppy seconds
Give'm here, give'm here

[Refrain: Watsky with Myrtle Gunderson]
I don't care where you've been
How many miles, I still love you
I don't care where you've been
How many miles, I still love you

[Post-Chorus: Watsky with Myrtle Gunderson & Watsky]
I don't care (Cold pizza)
Where you've been (Tie-dye shirts)
How many (Broken hearts) miles, I still love you
I don't care (Hand me downs)
Where you've been (Leftovers)
How many (Sloppy seconds) miles, I still love you


Dedicated to Christina Li

[Verse 1]
The first time I went back to homeroom from the hospital
I thought that being more embarrassed was impossible
But God, the second time it really turned my stomach
Now I’m the kid who collapses and then spazzes out in public
This time was a bowling alley, the first was in the yard
And kids in middle school just watched me trip and kicked me hard
Except this girl named Crissie Li, who flips around at her desk
And gives me the world’s biggest Disney card
Wrote “best wishes,” and “kisses” where she signed it
3 feet by 2 feet, I coulda hid behind it
I didn’t like the pity from Christina Li though
I’m thinking “Crissie, can’t you see I’m busy being emo?”
‘Cause I think I mighta heard she maybe sorta liked me
And since she wasn’t cool enough I guess I took it lightly
Had braces and glasses and wasn’t Mrs. Popular
And so I didn’t really give a thought to her

[Chorus]
A heart breaking sounds like guitar strings snapping
It’s the notes of the song that’ll never happen
And the wind in the leaves is the sound of ghosts clapping
But a heart breaking sounds like guitar strings snapping

[Verse 2]
There’s holes in my memory- it isn’t photographic
There’s holes in my yearbook but the cut-out folks were plastic
Ten years pass, I don’t cross paths
With half the people from my class again 'til we meet at Crissie’s open casket
Those who chose to ask it probably knew
I could have dug in deeper if I’d wanted to
But you couldn’t tell a thing was off on the surface
And I didn’t know she was sick until I heard about her service
She was born with a heart defect, used to the cold knife
She’d been in and out of hospitals her whole life
She knew the whole time, and never said why
She felt my pain herself and helped me hold my head high
The nicest folks are those who know the throes of crisis
Though I know it’s crime to twist her life to fit my own devices
Why’s it so hard to mourn, and then try to learn by this
But lights that burn shortest
Are the lights that burn brightest

[Chorus]
A heart breaking sounds like guitar strings snapping
It’s the notes of the song that’ll never happen
And the wind in the leaves is the sound of ghosts clapping
But a heart breaking sounds like guitar strings snapping

[Verse 3]
Our 8th grade yearbook page for dedicating songs wasn’t long
Even in a school eleven hundred strong
The yearbook advertised for months, but when it’s said and done
Crissie bought six, the third most of anyone
Alvin got “Your Faith in Me” by Jessica Simpson
Pebbles got Richard Marx’s ballad “At the Beginning”
It feels like sloppy poetry the way her life would end
After sending Mariah Carrey’s “Any Time You Need a Friend"
But corniness is honesty that’s wrapped in cliché
And most slow jam lyrics aren’t shit I’m brave enough to say without a smirk
But before she went to dirt she left us finally
"I Will Remember You” to Geoff, Mike, Bry and me
You can plot if you must
Say it’s obviously fate, or explain that God is just
But all I know is that until my body’s dust
I will try to think of her as much as Crissie thought of us

[Outro]
This one goes out to Christina


Skit #2

[KID]
Yeah, I've been doing that
I've been doing that ever since I was in kindergarten
I've been doing that for a long long long long, long long long long long long time

[WATSKY]
(laughs)
Oh, when did it actually get really bad though?

[KID]
I was turning the age I am right now

[WATSKY]
Which is how old?

[KID]
Eight

[WATSKY]
Eight is a good year, eight is maybe the finest year

[KID]
The only thing is that
The only problem with that is that you're getting closer to being ten
That's the real problem

[WATSKY]
You don't wanna turn ten?

[KID]
I mean, I mean, that's the only problem with it
I mean you're like, you're being closer to ten every time you change in age
And when you're close to ten

[WATSKY]
It's all over

[KID]
Yeah, you might not like the things you used to like, right?


The Legend of Hardhead Ned

[Narration]
Once upon a time in a remote Tasmanian trailer park
There was born a baby boy by the name of Nedson Willbry
One day when Nedson was a baby, his crackhead teen mum
Got real distracted watching Teen Mum on the telly and dropped Ned right on his noggin
Leaving a bump on the top of his head
The little bean stopped squirming
And his mum thought he was surely done for
So mommy brought the tiny bundle to the forest during a terrible storm
And left him for dead in a field of pumpkins and wolves

[Verse 1]
Just then lighting struck
And a cry cut through the night light like a siren on a fire truck
Ned survived by the slightest luck, he wasn’t a dead baby, Neddy was alive as fuck!
It was a miracle we’re hearing
The creatures of the evening came creeping to the clearing
To see this little man nugget
Soon to be immortalized in poetry just like the man from Nantucket
But as the little babe was grown
They gave to him their home
And raised him as their own
He roamed and trapezed from the tallest trees (whee!)
He got his steez from the wallabies
They all loved him
But the Tasmanian Devils loved little Neddy more than all of ‘em
They taught him how to spin like a fan
'Til Ned spun himself into a fine young man
But one day like a sick disease
Loggers crept in and chopped the eucalyptus trees
They smushed the cuddly forest creatures
And turned ‘em into body wash and sneakers
But Ned escaped and yelled angrily
That "You abandoned me!
You killed my family!
But God dammit, I can’t use your pity"
And he snuck onto a ship bound for New York City

[Narration]
Ned’s voyage led him to the deepest, darkest, dankest bowels of that ship
He met all kinds of seedy characters on that voyage, like old Japanese men and their wives
He had delicious meals of fresh cut sashimi, pumpkin pie
And all kinds of delicious breads and cookies and cakes
When he was on that voyage he knew what lied ahead
So he kept his sights set on New York City
And before he knew it, he arrived

[Verse 2]
Ned almost drowned
He kissed the ground
But his guts were churned up in this town
Where down was up and up was down
So the boy from Down Under flipped right around
Ned did a cartwheel and stopped halfway
And he walked on his palms from that day
But city-folk treated Ned like a freak
“That hand-walking lump-headed Yeti can’t speak”
One night walking home Ned was quite shocked
He saw a B-boy spinning on the sidewalk
He couldn’t stop, wouldn’t stop
Staring at those limbs, spinning like a wooden top
Sweeter than a puddin’ pop, Ned was home at last
And every night he’d watch ‘em dance through the glass
Of the club, and he’d wait there in line for his chance
But the bouncer said, freak, you can’t dance!


[Narration]
Oh but Ned, sweet little Ned, he wouldn’t get out of line
And the bouncer pushed him, and pushed him
But to catch his balance, Ned, hardheaded, upside down Ned did what Ned did best
He just spun. And he spun. And he spun. And he spun!
(Go Ned, go Ned, go, go, go Ned!)
Everyone in the club came out to watch what is now regarded
As the greatest fucking head spin of all time
Legend has it that Ned’s still out there on Bleecker Street
Spinning on the curb to this very day

Cardboard Castles

[Hook]
Out on the curb again
On the curb again
I’ve come to learn it’s hard and firm
Out on the curb again
Out on the curb again
On the curb again
I’ve come to learn it’s hard and firm
Out on the curb again

[Bridge]
I’m in my room making cardboard castles
With shoestring rope
Soup spoon drawbridge
Tinfoil moat
I’m still dreaming after all these years
I’m in my room making cardboard castles
With shoestring rope
Soup spoon drawbridge
Tinfoil moat
I’m still dreaming after all these years

[Verse 1]
Because if we don’t build it, who will?
I do things on a shoestring that you couldn’t do for a cool mil
I run with no laces, and when I fall, I start
To build my Taj Mahal with shit I found at Dollar Mart
This life’s our greatest project
The journey’s all an art
But I built my perfect nest and it’s ‘bout to fall apart
Again and again and then I just I make it twice as high
And I give my tower teeth, and I watch it bite the sky
Because I might just cry if I don’t keep it moving
I focus on what I can make and not what just got ruined
‘Cause every stone will crumble down to dust, to dust, to dust
And I say love thy neighbor, and I say fuck thy hater
There’s nothing I can’t solve with duct tape and construction paper
I don’t want a Band-Aid, I’ll only rip it off, I’ll rip it off

[Hook]
Out on the curb again
On the curb again
I’ve come to learn it’s hard and firm
Out on the curb again
Out on the curb again
On the curb again
I’ve come to learn it’s hard and firm
Out on the curb again

[Verse 2]
I know someday I’ll pass, and maybe then rest
I’m laying on my back;
Heaven’s my bench press
‘Cause my imagination is crazy as Glenn Beck
A cloud is floating by in the shape of a rent check
And when the world ends, that’s what I’ll plan towards
Then I’ll trust girlfriends and maybe landlords
Cause I been played but I’m looking for more
I say, "What would I gain if I took it to court?"
‘Cause if people were perfect then there wouldn’t be war
We stay pushing but once we get a foot in the door
We get our toes chopped off and a foot of manure
I still gotta believe people
Are good at the core
‘Cause if we weren’t, what’s at stake?
Why would we stay to break what we make
And create all these beautiful mistakes
When they blow our house down let’s draw on the walls, the walls, the walls

[Bridge]
I’m in my room making cardboard castles
With shoestring rope
Soup spoon drawbridge
Tinfoil moat
I’m still dreaming after all these years
I’m in my room making cardboard castles
With shoestring rope
Soup spoon drawbridge
Tinfoil moat
I’m still dreaming after all these years

[Hook]
Out on the curb again
On the curb again
I’ve come to learn it’s hard and firm
Out on the curb again
Out on the curb again
On the curb again
I’ve come to learn it’s hard and firm
Out on the curb again

[Bridge]
I’m in my room making cardboard castles
With shoestring rope
Soup spoon drawbridge
Tinfoil moat
I’m still dreaming after all these years
I’m in my room making cardboard castles
With shoestring rope
Soup spoon drawbridge
Tinfoil moat
I’m still dreaming after all these years


Send in the Sun

[Chorus]
Send in that sunshine
Make everything right
Turn on your love light
Cause baby I’m coming on by
Send in that sunshine
Make everything right
Cause there ain’t no suffering in life
That don’t ease with the passage of time

[Verse 1]
If stars died of old age
They wouldn’t explode, they’d burn out with a slow fade
But stars escape life with a gun shot
Which makes me think they stick a pistol in their sun spot
Bite the barrel, squeeze the trigger
Might have cared once, but the obstacles seem bigger
And they’re stuck behind a giant 8 ball
The milky way is star brains that are smeared across the space wall
You know the red giant in sector two?
Yeah, Hector, true, he was a depressing dude
I think he thought nobody thought about him
And now that I think about it, I’m liable to guess it’s true
Everybody wants the sun to come and cure their rough moods but suns need love too
I give out energy and don’t receive. I’m tired now, I’ll go to sleep
And when this is the coldest solstice, maybe folks’ll notice me

[Chorus]
Send in that sunshine
Make everything right
Turn on your love light
Cause baby I’m coming on by
Send in that sunshine
Make everything right
Cause there ain’t no suffering in life
That don’t ease with the passage of time

[Verse 2]
Goodbye Maggie, Goodbye Jules
I wish you’d stuck around, you wise fools
Cause friends they tend to come and go
The way the ocean ebbs and flows but there’s reminders in the tide pools
But when the standing water’s putrid
Who am I to say a choice you made was stupid?
There’s a bunch of us who loved you
Fucking stuck here pointing fingers at ourselves for something you did
You you you you you packed your problems in a suitcase
You you you went away forever to a new place
You left behind a lot of blue faces and bouquets and loose ends like shoelaces
But my friend, it’s too late
So all my lightweights and barflies, let’s raise a pint each time a star dies
And toast the memory of hard lives
Filed on the interstellar hard drives and archives


Dent in the Moon

[Chorus]
Swing, out of your shoes
And if you should lose this time
Keep on swinging and swinging and soon
When you connect
With all of your strength
Look up and you might see a dent in the moon

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you see them craters?
That was ‘cause a kid said there’d be none greater
In ten years Hammering Hank was at the plate launching balls into space saying see ya later
Skinny as a toothpick but he got a knack
Watch him swing a broomstick at a bottlecap
Watch him rinse and repeat till he’s on the map
Going from the cheap seats to the autographs
Papa put a bat in my hand and all he said was never ever, ever, ever rock a Dodger hat
And whether you win or you didn’t you gotta be getting dirty
And we better send your jersey to the laundromat
It was in the cards
I knew someday I’d be a big league star
Playing second base for the Giants wearing number 9 rocking knee-high socks
If I just worked hard

[Chorus]
Swing, out of your shoes
And if you should lose this time
Keep on swinging and swinging and soon
When you connect
With all of your strength
Look up and you might see a dent in the moon

[Verse 2]
We had our 6th grade baseball tryouts on the basketball courts
So a fastball—had hops
We didn’t have a grass field and so coach hit us grounders
Off the asphalt—I dropped
A lot and so he hit ‘em faster and I took ‘em off my ankles
Yelling that’s all you got?
And when I saw my name on the roster I went insane
Like I was sniffing bath salts, I’m not—here to play soft
I’ll go beastmode on a piñata and bite its motherfucking face off
Until it rains candy out of its neck-hole
I don’t go flexing my pecs, or get swole
I wasn’t the fastest
And when I moved it kinda looked like I was running through molasses—true
It’s silly to give a shit about a game but earth
Is a little ball that’s spinning on its axis—too

[Chorus]
Swing, out of your shoes
And if you should lose this time
Keep on swinging and swinging and soon
When you connect
With all of your strength
Look up and you might see a dent in the moon

[Verse 3]
I wasn’t cut out for the bigs, guess I been a fool
And middle school was just a bit of cruel ridicule
But when you step into the ranks of the man
It’s like they push you from the high dive to the kiddie pool (thanks)
It’s time to ballroom waltz that plank
We’re little minnows in a small shark tank
You try to swim without getting blood in the water
But you’re all heart and guts like a ballpark frank
Never an all-star
I had to keep score
If I were perfect I would quit and join the Peace Corps
I’m not a hero, if I didn’t try my doubts eat at me
Like I’m a carcass on the sea floor
So say this shit is too corny
It tastes better to me than, ‘ooh poor me’
I’m just trying to sing a different tune
And then fit into a world that didn’t have room for me

[Chorus]
Swing, out of your shoes
And if you should lose this time
Keep on swinging and swinging and soon
When you connect
With all of your strength
Look up and you might see a dent in the moon
Swing, out of your shoes
And if you should lose this time
Keep on swinging and swinging and soon
When you connect
With all of your strength
Look up and you might see a dent in the moon

All You Can Do

All You Can Do

Happy's not a faucet that'll flow when a handle is turned
I wanna handle my shit, but it hasn't occurred
I need the stamina, keep on like my grandmama
When I'm not on camera I gotta be a man of my word
And be a greater guy, not some thin-as-paper guy
Like the times that Georgie Porgie kissed the girl
And made her cry, saying, see ya later, bye
Shit I say is pretty strange
Coming back for Christmas and we bitch on how the city changed
Fuck it, man, we're changing too, look at what we going through
Mama used to buy me shirts she said that I would grow into
But it's draping on me like an apron or a cape,
A great tsunami wave of cotton that I'm caught in
That she bought at Ross—I know the cost of it was probably awesome
But my style is sorta sloppy
I'll fit it when I blossom like a California Poppy
The tears are freezing on my cheek in Boston out in Copley
And I don't really know why, no I don't really know why

All you can do, is
All you can do, is
All you can do, is
All you can do, is

So pour that liquor out. I never chickened out
But if I got to make a second pick I'd take a different route
But a grip of my decisions pretty Mickey Mouse
I tried to join the 27 Club, they kicked me out
It was like I'm limping into heaven while my dick is out
And there's Amy Winehouse sitting on a cloud and drinking stout
But she spits it out the moment I come gliding in
She's all like, "come on Joplin, who the fuck invited him?!
Hide all of the Heinekens!" No, they don't know my name
My heart is lowkey broken so I'm taking Novocain
And Jimmy Morrison the doors, and Brian Jones, you know, the Stones
Are joking, toking on a roach playing a poker game
I know that I'm a bastard. The walls are alabaster
Jimi plays his Stratocaster jamming out with Kurt Cobain
They're playing Purple Rain, or maybe Purple Haze
And Kurt says, "How the fuck they let this jerk in with his hurtful ways?"
I try to jump and spread my wings like I'm a bird of prey
But I hit the earth and break a mothafucka's vertebrate (hey)
I guess I'm fucking up the blueprint for success
Woke up in the hospital with Jimi's bootprints on my chest
This recklessness, no common senses
I Kamikaze, there's consequences
I don't condone it, but I did it, I'ma own it
I've been living for the moment gotta go (go!)
'Cause
All you can do, is
All you can do, is
All you can do, is
All you can do, is
All you can do, is
All you can do, is
All you can do, is
All you can do, is


Stand for Something

[Chorus]
Never been the one to play it cool
I never been a fan of fancy shoes
I only want to stand for something
I don’t care if they approve
They don’t know what I’ve been through
I only want to stand for something

[Verse 1]
What was I thinking when I headed to SoCal?
Everybody gotta order the low-cal or no-cal meal
I don't even enjoy guilt
I think the city turned my semen to soymilk
But I’m a motherfuckin' hypocrite
Acting like I never give a shit
But now I think about it maybe a tad bit
'Cause pretty baby, I be ready to admit
I'm thinking, maybe I will never be Brad Pitt
Want the celebrity? You gotta be bat shit
To want to be a piece of meat, we treat 'em as cold cuts
But go nuts when we see 'em wiping their own butts
And the crowd goes wild
But we don't smile if you got no style
Gotta be kidding me, giving the pretty people the key to the city
I don't even know
[Chorus]
Never been the one to play it cool
I never been a fan of fancy shoes
I only want to stand for something
I don’t care if they approve
They don’t know what I’ve been through
I only want to stand for something

[Verse 2]
We struttin'
Ain't nobody gotta tell us nothing
Because a rose is a rose and I am what I am
And I wear it like a campaign button
I don't want a side eye
I say bye-bye
Roll up another one and hand me a Mai tai
Because the people who be running the show
Are kinda like the season how they come and they go
And we'll be living while they looking for parking
And we'll be digging while they woofing and barking
They kicking in the door and hoping to barge in
But this is what you get, there's nothing to bargain
If it's a hundred to one and we're under the gun
I'm not gonna be groveling for the governor's pardon
Don't gotta suck in your gut if you want to guzzle a Bud
I'm about it, baby, you can party with us

Bet Against Me
[Verse]
You will if you didn't feel it before
Ever since I was a kid, never really been bored
Swinging from building to building with my umbilical cord
But they don't know what I really endured
They say Godzilla been summoned but we're not running
Attila the Hun is coming, we killin' his horde
Spilling my innards, I fell on my sword
And now my blood is filling up from the ceiling to floor
I'm swimming though it, I'm swallowing fluid
Knew I had to do it so I grew like a million gills
Cause evolution is kill or be killed
Your Mrs. isn't equipped to be having kids
Have her listen to what I'm spitting
It’s like sniffing fertility pills
This illegitimate village idiot bridging original shit with digital
Catching a carrier pigeon, sticking a chip in his wing and hitching a ride
But there's a glitch in the system inside
Got this ambition, I'm keeping the freshest fish in my kitchen
I catch 'em quick when I get 'em to bite (right)
This kind of killin' could fill a pelican bill
And my delicatessen will keep my recipe tight (right)
You kinda Gollumy, go ahead, try to follow me
But if you're solid we build a colony, bruh
Calling Me Maybe, they poppin' molly
These babies are sniffling like they're chuggin' some quality phở

[Interlude: Paul Watsky]
…I’m playing with the house’s money now, cause I thought we were on our way out during the Cuban Missile Crisis. I was, ah, in my late teens—I fell asleep waiting for the missile to fall dead center on my apartment, crash through the ceiling, and that was gonna be the end of everything. And I was amazed when I woke up the next morning and I was still alive…

Whoa Whoa Whoa

[Chorus]
Whoa whoa whoa
What do you take us for?
Whoa whoa whoa
What do you take us for?

[Verse 1]
I'm a phenomenon, and I gotta bring pain in The Octagon
When I wanna spit game at a soccer mom
I get it quicker than the left lane on the Autobahn, fast
Like Ramadan, had to battle young padawans all the damn day
I'm getting naked and I'm hopping on a wrecking ball
So hot, I got the motherfucker a la flambé
I go to Miley's house, I see that Miley's home
I play Miley's ribcage with my dick, like it's a Xylie-phone
Yes, that was highly fucked up but my skills are highly honed
And if I was highly hyphy, I might be more widely-known
C'est la vie, better pay my fee
They kick it in Seattle in a Patagonia jacket
They get it in the Bay in a plain white tee
Hey mami! You a P.Y.T
You wanna see me speak, then I go, go, go, go!
Cause, every time I get a beat, I know I gotta beat it up
I bend it then I break it then I chop it then I eat it up
And PETA would never approve of the way
I've been treating the music, I bleed it, I bruise it
I kick it to the curb and then I'm sipping on my bourbon
I be freaking it, doing it, keeping it moving
I'm picking apart the muscle when I'm thinking about the hustle
But I'm nice, nice!
[Chorus]
Whoa whoa whoa
What do you take us for?
Whoa whoa whoa
What do you take us for?

[Verse 2]
I jump the freeway median, I'm savage
Cause my mode is that I'm meaner than the average
Like my teacher taught me when I heard the crowd applaud
I thought I was an atheist until I realized I'm a God
It could hurt a bit when I murder shit
In a moment, I'll be taking off a tourniquet
When I burn them and I hit them in the sternum
I don't even got to enter, but I'm gonna win the tournament
That's what I'm all about
I do what I got to do and never gonna pout
And I hope that it would have been the end of it and I'm out
But they never tend to give me the benefit of the doubt
Ever since I was a little kid
I know that I've been looking for the hot, hot spotlight
And if you really wonder what I think about the competition
They were not-not-not tight
I've been reading my scripture
Every photo bomber wanna be in my picture
And you better bet I'm living every single day
Like it's the motherfucking Catalina Wine Mixer
Bada bing, bada boom!
When I walk in, I'm the king of the room
And I get it locked in like a king in a tomb
When I spit a toxin and they cough on the fumes
Cause I'm back in the nick of time and attacking the fickle mind
I'm a jackal, I'll rip his hide, I'ma tackle him, pick a fight
I be Dracula, set to bite in the black of the bitter night
And I'm out, poof

[Chorus]
Whoa whoa whoa
What do you take us for?
Whoa whoa whoa
What do you take us for?
Whoa whoa whoa
What do you take us for?
Whoa whoa whoa
What do you take us for?


Ink Don't Bleed

[Verse 1: Watsky]
Some got hits about the racks that they earn
Say, there's Benjamins and Jacksons in their pockets to burn
But when they shoot the video, producers pass around a bucket
Full of rented jewelry for them to rock and return
I know a straight edge rapper who acts like a sheep herder
A vegan on the mic, who's screaming that meat's murder
But when everybody's sleeping, he be creeping
Slugging back the whiskey, hating himself and sneaking a cheeseburger
There's a pop idol at the top of the charts
And when her record's being cut, she's on the beach in St. Bart's
While a session singer, who didn't have the face to make it
Signs a nondisclosure agreement and belts out her parts
It's hard, 'cause I got bars that are big-uppin' Woody Allen
But maybe he's a predator who's digging in his talons
There's a balance, and often I don't know how to feel
In a fake and tainted world, seek the real

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Now, I can't change the past, but
A man's gotta man up
It's hard to believe, tch
Sometimes, I get the best of me
Now, I'm doing what I can, but
I'm a man, not a damn chump
I can say it if you need
But I'd rather let the ink bleed

[Verse 2: Watsky]
We dismiss our heroes' skeletons, no matter how grim
My fans saying, "I'd be honored to be injured by him"
Well, fam', this branch is thin, but I'll go out on a limb
To say she didn't love her ulna poking out of her skin
Being pumped full of morphine and tied to machines
They cut off my jeans, I heard her in the ambulance scream
She's in school to do tattoos and might've had nerve damage
So it could've cost a girl a chance at her dream
Meanwhile, he pops painkillers until the dude is numb
Knew I was a stupidass, just not that I'm a ruthless one
Youth is easily influenced, so should you be rooting for me
If I touch a thousand lives, but on the way, I ruin some?
The rule of thumb is "All publicity is your advantage"
But human lives are not collateral damage
Bandage the wounded, then vanish, blank as the newest of canvases
When they zoom in the cameras, give them the truth

[Verse 3: Watsky]
Megachurch leaders sleeping with male hookers
Mayors hitting crack pipes with their cookers
Each week, a crooked politician gets caught
We're not shocked when they're cheaters — these days, we're shocked when they're not
Are they the person you thought if they're perfect and hot?
Often, we blame the victim, scoffing "They deserve what they got"
Actors sweep it under the rug and resume with the plot
But they're amateurs, and we can see the boom in the shot
If perception is reality, then this could be a shocker
I've done my share of fucked-up things that didn't get on Gawker
Lots of tiny indiscretions way beyond the public eye
That, if you saw, would probably out me as a complicated guy
Mike says you got to separate the person from the art
But if the art's about that person, you can't pull 'em apart
So you better watch the choices that you're making now, because
They aren't something that matter, they're the only thing that does

[Refrain: Watsky]
Everything they say conflicts with everything I do
But I must admit I did it, so I guess it might be true
Everything they say conflicts with everything I do
But I must admit I did it, so I guess it might be true
Everything they say conflicts with everything I do
But I must admit I did it, so I guess it might be true
Everything they say conflicts with everything I do
But I must admit I did it, so I guess it might be true


Right Now
[Verse 1]
It's '86 when my mama has me
30 seconds later when the doctor slaps me
15 years til I get my permit
And then 4 more til we're in the backseat
Of a taxi, crazy youngfolk
And then sun came up but none woke
It's 4:20 when I made that dumb joke
I was saying something like blah blah blunt smoke
And then it's later in the afternoon
In my backyard when we write this tune
2 days later when I pen the verses
Probably 8 months til you first heard it
So punch the clock, adjust your tie
Spike the punch and touch the sky
Life is hard and then you die
So let's all go hard tonight

[Chorus]
Remembering the days that felt so long
I bet you miss me
We spent the whole day dreaming, our minds made up
We're making history
Right now is right now
Too loud to die down
Right now is right now
No other time now

[Verse 2]
If time is money a second's a penny a minute's buck a couple years are a milly I'm getting really really filthy
Bitch, get me a bathtub!
I'm filthy rich, watching my pennies stack up
I shower in a typhoon
If time is dimes then I'm a tycoon
I'll glue em together and the climb to the moon
Climb to the moon! Climb to the moon!
We on Today, Today, Matt Laur
Every 24 we going like Jack Bauer
Hear the bell ringing I'm thinking it's that hour
Turning on my light and I set it to max power
Let's keep it going and going, I'm talking moment to moment we live the high and the low
And then when we're broken like cracking open a coconut we pull ourselves together again and we gotta go

My First Stalker
[Verse 1]
She freaked when she saw me
Calmly eating my tamale
She followed me home from the diner
Now all day she be on me
On the other side of the street
You can see her through the blinds if you peek
With a book propped up on her knees and the blue hair
What do you care when I'm home what I do there?

You're creeping out my neighbors
When they grab the paper
You probably think I'm inside
Like some kind of savior
Solving world hunger
Working on Sudoku
And filling in the numbers
Polishing my halo
Ooh I bet you wonder
Life can be bogus
We all wanna be noticed
But we're the ones in the background fuzzy
When the ones in the front are in focus
And it's pretty difficult in general
When you really think a person is incredible
And I get it why you're setting em up on a pillar
But the bigger the tumble the bigger the pedestal

Frankly I am flattered
We all want to matter
Do you see when you pass by
That we let the grass die?
I'm late with the rent check
We park on the lawn
Like we're a bunch of fuckin rednecks
I'm just watching Netflix
Jerking off to porno
(I have a subscription!)
And I got a suspicion
You think my life is different
I get your confusion
But you got some delusions
Yeah I'm fucking awesome
But I gotta out you
You probably think I'm in there
Writing songs about you (ooooh!)

The One
[Verse 1]
Everywhere I look it seems like everybody's pairing off
I'm staring at the pairs like they were tits on Lara Croft
Even all the dogs I see are clicking so terrific
Picking out their favorite puppy's ass to sniff and stickin with it
All the faker single ladies twerkin to Beyoncé
Every single one of em is somebody's fiancée
You never spilled your guts. You wanted to yell your say
Wait a couple years and try again when they're divorcees
All the gentlemen are trynna get the pussy, wanna make that pelvis scream
But when I hit it and I quit it then it never really helps my self-esteem
We want some tonsil hockey, but we got hecka cocky
Overfished the ocean, so we're running low on tekka maki
Sushi douchey dudes are saying 'do me' but we're doomed
We run away from keepers and go creepin on the goons
Most men and women full of crap, need a laxative
Want the ass when I'm waxin it, Uncle Sam how I'm taxin it
Do a backflip and try to land in it, then abandon it, pretty soon we're back to

[Hook]
1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 3, 4

Wonderland is where I'll find an Alice who is radical
But I'm drunk on Facebook now and diving down that rabbit hole
Checkin on my ex and soon I'm creepin on her lover
And when the picture buffers I see her new boyfriend's buffer than me
Got those upper pecs his fuckin V-neck couldn't cover
My dick is pretty lonely but my nuts still got each other
I suffer, suffer from a habit, yes I'm an addict
But someone else is out there, it's just simple mathematics
There's over 7 billion mothafuckas on the planet and 4 billion of us are of legal age
That's 2 billion ladies, 4 billion tittays, and I bet a couple of em aren't engaged
And I get it you've been looking for the one but they been running trynna hide like Kony
And you're gonna find em if you're getting back into the saddle, baby ride that pony
And if you never get over that early lover then it sucks for you
Gotta admit that it's difficult to be watching her with him but everybody want a love that's true
I'm waiting, batin’ patiently, yo I'm a catch
I'm losing my head, playing musical beds, and looking for “the one” that match

[Hook]
1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 3, 4
I don’t believe in “the one”
1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 3, 4
There’s no such thing as “the one”



Boomerang

[Verse 1]
I hear a little patience what a man need
But bottling the feelings’ll make a man bleed
The words leave my mouth in a stampede
Watch em galloping, breaking records for land speed
My heart pumps and my lips tend to obey
You're just so Bay, I hope you don't say “no way”
Now that I came back around to OK
And if you let me I will love you till we go grey
So be my do-ray-me-fa-so-la-ti-do
We'll hit El Farolito, and get a bomb burrito
I try to kill my ego when your subject appears
But I still think of you when I had a couple of beers
I'll see you soon I got no use for a bucket of tears
It seemed unlucky how we'd orbit each other for years
We got our timing right and then I collided with you
The wait is worth it in the moment we finally do

[Chorus]
What I told you maybe half was true
I know neither of us have a clue
I'm always coming back to you
Your boo, your boo, your boomerang
I know neither of us have the key
But I'm telling you, you have to see
How you're always coming back to me
My boo, my boo, my boomerang

[Verse 2]
You press my buttons like I were a Nintendo
Me and her up in a permanent limbo
It's like it’s nothing when we're burnin the indo
The streetlights like a blur in the window
I got no cause to feel I was betrayed
It's just a symptom of the of the game we played
We pull the hearts out of each others' chests, pull the pins out of the hearts
And toss em back and forth like they're grenades
Hot potato, hot potato, what did you do?
Blow my fuckin arm off and then kiss the booboo
Hit me with a shovel, and then say "I dig you"
And be colder than an igloo
When you want me I don't want you, when I want you, you don't want me
When I sing a tune and you sing it too then it's "womp womp" in the wrong key
You always let me go and do my thang
But I'm always coming back again—boomerang

[Chorus]
What I told you maybe half was true
I know neither of us have a clue
I'm always coming back to you
Your boo, your boo, your boomerang
I know neither of us have the key
But I'm telling you, you have to see
How you're always coming back to me
My boo, my boo, my boomerang


Lets Get High and Watch Planet Earth

Why don't we get high and watch Planet Earth?

Planet Earth, Planet Earth
Watch it spin, watch it spin
You and me, planet earth

And yes, yes, let's let's let's get some takeout
Press our hearts together like when kids make Barbies make out
Let's make out, no toothpaste
I only want to know how you taste
We don't need to tie no shoelace
And we don't need to pack no suitcase
To, to find a new place. Let our moment linger
We'll weave our hands together and then kiss this braid of fingers
Until the whisper, whisper of time's undying rivers
Come decorate our skin with crow's feet, spider-veins and fissures
But we won't cry, we won't cry, we'll step into that cyclone
Together when we're blinded and our minds erode like limestone
And all we can remember is how we make each other feel, then

Why don't we get high and watch Planet Earth?

Ah, the hippies, ah, were sort of wide-eyed with floppy pants and things like that
I thought there were some good things about what they were doing—a lot of good things
Especially the sex


Hand Over Hand

It's the American dream
But if you pull on the thread, it's gonna tear at the seam
See what I mean? We don't tend to scream
Baby, we just stare at the screen
Like it's a preacherman up at the pulpit
Some with the scars end up holding the bullwhip
Another angry kid unloading a full clip
And I could tie a pretty bow on this bullshit
But let's not lie for another second
We see the trouble, we're rubberneckin
No doublecheckin, if it's an issue we have to grapple
The words are caught in my Adam's apple
I make my body a happy chapel
'Cause every person's a tabernacle
But there's no feeling you gotta hide
So let's all pray to the God inside, say it now

Never needed a hand til you needed a hand
You never know how to walk until you understand
Coulda been anything that you needed to be
How many more do you want? How many more do you need?
Still I wish I could break free
It's that same old simple song I still believe
How many more do we need?
Before it's hand over hand
Love over everything

That's me with the long arm
Screaming at the top dog, spilling my blood on the cement
We willing to roll now, sick of getting mowed down
Fuck if I dope now, it'd kill me
'Cause I'd rather be known for the dealing
Than known to be hooked on the feeling
How many more gotta go now? How many more gotta go down?
I'll stand in the rain witcha
Just to get a little bit of glimpse of the plain picture
People need a pinch just to get em to wake up
You'll be in a ditch before I get you to wake up, say it bruh
Whoever said it wasn't fair, they was telling the truth
I'd be a liar if I said there was nothing to prove

Never needed a hand til you needed a hand
You never know how to walk until you understand
Coulda been anything that you needed to be
How many more do you want? How many more do you need?
Still I wish I could break free
It's that same old simple song I still believe
How many more do we need?
Before it's hand over hand
Love over everything

They say we gotta know our role
Kiss the bottom of the totem pole
Set goals, and then go for gold
But we hibernate and hide inside our gopher holes
I wanna smoke a bowl, a hand on my dick
While the other one is busy clicking the remote control
I'm no Dalai Lama of the sofa but I hear I gotta go to
Where the sinners face the roasting coals
You say that your heart ain't got no holes, well bitch please
Let's all admit that we got souls like Swiss cheese
But wishing isn't gonna fill this abyss
And no hand over hand over fisted riches is fixin what's missin
If I wanna kill this monotony
I know the answer is a light that I got in me
I got no university degree in philosophy
But I know that every baby's born with the lock and key

Never needed a hand til you needed a hand
You never know how to walk until you understand
Coulda been anything that you needed to be
How many more do you want? How many more do you need?
Still I wish I could break free
It's that same old simple song I still believe
How many more do we need?
Before it's hand over hand
Love over everything


Tears to Diamonds
They press our teardrops into diamonds
They change our sorrows into gold
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
We just need someone we can hold
Got an issue but it's getting bigger and bigger
In the beginning it was something minor
Got a rat up in my kitchen and we gotta get rid of it
So we're bringing in a tiger
There's something inside her
Thought you were blissful
I heard you did it with a pink-handled pistol
But sadness, it tend to latch on
And it won't let go like a pitbull
Don't even know if you left a note
Should we blame the Depakote?
Or vilify the Abilify?
You were trying to find your vanilla sky
Then you unravel
Face down on rock bottom fucking chewing gravel
Because a human's so fragile. What can you do?
They press our teardrops into diamonds
They change our sorrows into gold
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
We just need someone we can hold
They press our teardrops into diamonds
But they can't change our hearts to stone
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
I know that we are not alone
I know it's sappy
But I want my family to be happy
Without becoming flatter than a sheet of paper
An army of zombies shuffling through a vapor
But I know folks who found something beautiful
And they credit the pharmaceuticals
For slaying the demons that they're running from
It might have saved their lives and I'm one of em
But there's a limit to the shit you can endure
You get a prescription and you're thinking that it's pure
But baby maybe it's a problem when you got a problem
And you get addicted to the cure
The spike ain't not mystery
We're any penny in a billion dollar industry
And there's a mothafucka on living on the hill pushing pills
Stacking bills off our misery
Had a teaspoon that's full of pain
Got an ocean that's full of sorrow
Had a teaspoon that's full of pain
Got an ocean that's full of sorrow
They press our teardrops into diamonds
They change our sorrows into gold
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
We just need someone we can hold
They press our teardrops into diamonds
But they can't change our hearts to stone
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
I know that we are not alone



Grass is Greener

[Chorus]
Here, take my career
Give her your health
Let me have the love you share
I've been alone for a long time
Picked the faint praise of strangers
Over one who truly cares
He keeps the faith in a dark room
Fingers twitching like moth wings
Hoping to matter
But he can't see how he matters to you
You can't drink wine or coffee
And you're stuck with a body
That fights each small request you make

[Verse 1]
I got that brown grass dogs come pee on
Your grass so bright it's neon
Green and tie-dye and grows a mile high
We'll be betrayed by the seeds that we sow
Tiny blades grow and stab the earth from below
Your dying dreams bleeding out in the snow
You with the crumbling hips
She sees strangers eat oranges and clenches her fists
In these miles of highway
You're the prettiest pileup that I've ever glimpsed
I’m lost in the awful withdrawals
Grass seems much greener beyond these old walls
But my worries so small
When I walk through those hospital halls

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Tiny prayers you whisper to yourself (3x)

Never Let it Die

[Intro: Kush Mody & Anderson Paak]

[Chorus]
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die

[Verse 1]
Cause it isn't the fashion, the cash, and isn't the trashing hotels
It's the pit of the passion you feel, in the moment you crashed and you fell
Then get up and you're smashing it well, like it was a pistachio shell
And you gotta be gnashing your teeth, and be giving em hell
Cause to love is a radical act, give your brother a pat on the back
And if you get a panic attack, feel like you're at the back of the pack
An opinion's exactly that. If they say that your magic is black
Just do what you do when you do what you do, keep on pulling that rabbit from hat
You might think that you're ruined. You might think you're defeated
If you love what you're doing you've already succeeded
But there's gonna be bleeding, when another one bites that dust
So get ready to beat it, cause it might be us, and I'm telling em
That the journey is oh so slow and we wanna say “no no no”
Cause to make it is difficult, but we go go go
And my father was telling me that I better be ready ride on through
Cause I know that it's tough, but it's gotta be somebody, so then why not you?

[Chorus]
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die

[Verse 2]
Carry the spark as we're marching into the darkness
I don't care if they're marking where they bury my carcass
I'm working in this circus and searching for purpose
Learning from the bird who's perched on top of the church and chirpin a sermon
You want that early worm? Be the determined sparrow
Flying in loops around the sternest scarecrow
Once cupid hit me with his burning arrow
He lit the lava in my churning marrow
So when I'm tested I remember I've been blessed
With that tender ember resting left of center in my chest
And yes, if you fuck with us you'll see my game face
Cause no matter who you pray to when you say grace
And no matter where you come from in this great space
Every single person is escaping from the same place
So if you got a flame that's blazing hot within
Take a deep breath and feed it oxygen

[Chorus]
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die

[Interlude - Mom]
…So I was really interested and loved folk music, and then when I was in seventh grade, in the fall of 1963, I started getting interested in politics. This was about a year after my dad died, and I think it was a real way to connect with him… with my memories of him…

[Chorus]
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die

[Interlude - Poetry section]
Tore the pages from their Torahs, hurled torches at their doors
So they departed Polish ports and boarded boats to court the green lady with that copper torch who rose up gorgeous off the shore
Endured that stormy weather for me
Ellis Island, hellish journey
Maggots in the hard barley
Some shot off their own toes so they couldn't be forced to march in the Tsar's army
Bodies pitched in ditches, singed and bludgeoned
Burned the children in the ovens by the dozens
Burned the witches in New England by the coven
They burn the different ones, so clutch your cousins close
Cause such is life, it's cuts and strife, and stitches, punches, knives and hungry crows
Nothing guarantees survival
And we won’t stop this terror sticking flowers in the barrels of their rifles
We fight the hatred with the light
And when they think we'll fold and wave that bright rag
We won't surrender
We'll wipe the blood up with the white flag

Sarajevo

[Verse 1]
And they wonder what our parents say
And they wonder how we'll raise our children
And they tell me that I'm living with a monster
And they whisper that she took up with a villain
But I don't see dragon's scales
And I don't see claws and fangs
All I'm looking at is arms that hold me
Brown eyes that understand
And when she closed those eyes one final time no pipers came
But I know I got a love that's truer than a military sniper's aim
But we won't die in vain
Tie that chain around my waist
And pull me from the bottom of the pit of hell up to your final resting place

[Chorus 1]
Sarajevo, Sarajevo
You're the altar that I pray to
God is love and love is all we have

[Verse 2]
We were trynna run from the city
Had the hope and the pride of the kids
People wanna put up walls to divide us
Kinda fitting that we died on a bridge
Same souls, both sides of the banks
They say we're different and they're fillin in the facts
But they put the same metal in the bullets
And they put the same bullets in our backs
Kinda love that we got is one in a mill
Ain't no God that I pray to would wanna kill
It's not God but it's fear and it's politics
And a Molotov that was lit with a dollar bill
Don't say all is lost
Escape this holocaust
My God, Allah, my darling, star and crescent and my cross

[Chorus 2]
Sarajevo, Sarajevo
You're the altar that I pray to
God is love and love is all we have
Sarajevo, Sarajevo
I will honor and be faithful
God is love and love is all we have

[Verse 3]
Where do we come from? Where do we go?
You could fill up the sea with the things I don't know
But I know what I feel and I know when it's real
And I hope that we heal
We're two drops of the blood and the tears
Over thousands of years of the clash of the steel
I'm not blind to the cycle
We’re pressed in the spine of a Bible
They define the divine by the title
But what did Christ say? To be kind to my rival
You're my kind of revival
It's true ya, my favorite Hallelujah
You my you my favorite Hallelujah

[Chorus 2]
Sarajevo, Sarajevo
You're the altar that I pray to
God is love and love is all we have
Sarajevo, Sarajevo
I will honor and be faithful
God is love and love is all we have

[Outro]
Sarajevo, Sarajevo
You're the altar that I pray to
God is love and love is all we have
Sarajevo, Sarajevo
You're the altar that I pray to
God is love and love is all we have
Sarajevo, Sarajevo
You're the altar that I pray to
God is love and love is all we have
Sarajevo, Sarajevo
You're the altar that I pray to
God is love and love is all we have

Cannonball

[Chorus]
I don’t know what was wrong
But I wasn’t as strong
I’ve seen daisies hold cannonballs above them
But if this was a dream
I still know that I’ve seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them


[Poetry Section]
I’m so far from perfect
You still loved me when I so far from deserved it
If I’m so brave why does looking you in the eye take every ounce of my courage?
I hang my face to the linoleum and count the freckles on the floor
All of us, all of us are a galaxy of tiny little storms

The good and evil in me wage a bloody civil war
The missiles whistle through me then the rebel pistols roar
I shiver and the final slivers of my chivalry retreat my shriveled core
I can’t imagine that I’ll ever be happy like before

Before, before
We’re sitting in a field in Golden Gate Park off Fulton and 4th
And I’ve never felt less alone

Just a block from the home I’ve outgrown
Five feet and forty years to the right from where dad proposed

An inch above this casserole of stones, grass and mud, rusty needles, lost guitar picks, Indian tombs, and dinosaur bones

Everything happened all at once
And the world is spinning like a hubcap, and not just because of the drugs

We hugged and laid there in each others’ arms all night
Even when the sprinklers cried on us we didn’t mind
We had the rest of our lives to be dry

So we stayed until the edges of the sky turned light
I would have stayed until our hair turned white
The mosquitoes arrived to feast on time
Got drunk at our expense, we didn’t mind
We let them bite, we kept on kissing and obliged
Say “bottoms up, you’ve only got til Tuesday so enjoy the ride!”

And I couldn’t imagine that I would ever be unhappy again

And I whispered in your ear that this moment is already a poem
That I just figured out my first tattoo was going to be of bug bites
Decided I’d commemorate their bloody drink by printing three circles on my ankle, perfect and pink in permanent ink

The beautiful wounds that will keep me, you and this moment forever linked
To remind me when I fail myself, when I fail everyone around me
When I misfire and come tearing through your walls
When the cocktail of humiliation and pain poisons my veins
And this carnival of carnage, this mansion of garbage, this parking lot of carcasses, this heartbreak party drains the spirit that remains
That I have been a part of something worthwhile
To remind me of the pleasure of your pulse
The measure of your breath
The rise and fall of our fortunes and our chests
These spectacular triumphs and flops
That even if that moment meant nothing to the universe, it’s the closest thing to God I’ve got
I’m so far from perfect
So far it’s been worth it
[Bridge]
But if this was a dream
I still know that I've seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them

[Chorus]
I don’t know what was wrong
But I wasn’t as strong
I’ve seen daisies hold cannonballs above them
But if this was a dream
I still know that I’ve seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them


[Bridge]

But if this was a dream
I still know that I've seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them


X Infinity
Tiny Glowing Screens Part 3

[Intro]
Nothing matters, so it doesn't matter if nothing matters
And while you be, be true
And if you won't, fuck you
Burn your clothes
Open the wine
Close your eyes
Freeze time

[Verse 1: Watsky]
You’re officially welcome to grab your crotches
Synchronize your watches and pour us a couple scotches
People still as statues can’t catch you, turn pockets empty
If they’re packed with plenty move some to ones lacking any
While I take a crack at hacking the bank to jack em to cover high debts
You’re screening floating bullets with a butterfly net, if there’s any screaming
Pause it and cut out the sound, deposit the slugs underground
I’m positive that we don’t fuck around
No we go scooping up the diesel that’s leaking a sinking tanker
Forever stuck at anchor like beetles get stuck in amber
Halted like the thaw of the iceberg that shoulda sank her
Halted right beside the temperature spike and the spread of cancer
And all my peoples’ engagements and babies my friends are making
We quit getting lamer, days quit getting later, life quits being labor, quick—
You should come through to our party, dude bring your crew bring an army
Youth is inside of the heart, the future can never harm me
We’re never tardy (freeze, freeze, freeze)
Late or early don’t worry we’ll wait cause we’re in no hurry to see those pearly gates
I sit outside and watch the pigeon shit and tiny airplanes hanging in the sky and then I
Hit a McCartney show and trip off how his arm is superglued to his guitar and then I
Enjoy the lovely view and stand there for a month or two, my headphones looping Love Me Do on repeat
Paul might not die if we try to wall off this diorama, we’ll buy all the time we want and then spend it all to
Move this crowd—to join as converts to the church of blessed concerts and then conjure up some conversation
Yes, I’m proud—my country is my heart and so in every combination we all rep a common nation
That is how—I know that all we lepers and we shepherds join together now in holy congregation, everybody
Stop right now!

[Bridge: Camila Recchio & Watsky]
I want to hear the church bells ring
I want to see the fog roll in
I don’t mind the muddy water
I don’t mind the ocean wind
Show me I’m alive right now
Even if you gotta prick this skin
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes

[Verse 2]
Some days I throw my hands up like this shit right here is hopeless
But today I throw my hands up like this shit right here’s the dopest
I’ll never sew my family’s holes up saying hocus pocus
So I focus love on what is whole and chase my magnum opus
There’s so much more to life before I leave this skin behind me
Right now I’m feeling finer than Aaliyah in the 90s
Yeah, today I’m feeling firmly like my faith could never burn me
Like I’m apt to move that mountain just by glaring at it sternly
San Francisco used to seem bigger than Jupiter
From the view of an atom the human body's a universe
How impossibly big it be, this symmetry
This brutality, and beauty and synergy
And beyond what we'll live to see, I know nothing can limit me
Just take everything ever and we are that times INFINITY


Talking to Myself

[Verse 1]
One day you opened up your eyes inside of you
Inside a world inside a universe you didn't get to choose
You didn't get to pick the rules or pick the past or set the pace
Or cast the cast and crew
You didn't get to pick your starting place
And though it was a race you didn't understand
You simply lined up on the blocks and when the pistol popped you ran
And when you tripped and dropped, you picked yourself up off the ground
And picked your scabs and knew you had to pick a plan to end what you began
As you got older there were days of cold surrender
Days of shrugged whatevers folded in with days of shocking splendor
But as time advanced, the lovely days were covered up from view
By an advancing melancholy haze that hovered near the dew
Yet there were moments
There were these pure arresting moments when you stepped outside your head
Outside your pain, outside control, outside the bullshit, out of body, out of rage
Outside the need to get it, get it? You will never get it
That's okay

[Chorus]
Have you felt a little off today
Had a lot to say
But wound up talking to yourself?
I've been hunting for a kindly ear
But couldn't find one near
And wound up talking to myself

[Verse 2]
Had a little spot—where you been going through a lot
Wanna shove it to the bottom—but a trouble gonna bubble to the top
Then the bubble gonna pop—and the hustle never ever gonna stop
'Cause you get up in the morning get ahead, get to bed and then you do it all again until the moment that you drop
You need a plot—what you wanna witness with this life you got?
You kicked and fought tryna get up in your skin and pick this lock
That ticking clock lets you know that bitch you got these situations witchu
Issues someone fit to quick should sit you down to talk
Ever wonder who's the crazy the one—people walking to work as if nothing is off
But if a person really got it they would be cracking a bottle on somebody's head and looting from shops
Are there times you're alone knowin' nobody's home, but you walk around mutterin' under your breath second guessing shit saying, "Goddammit, goddammit, goddammit," just whispering soft
Do you ever get lost, deep in your thoughts, tripping when you think about the cost of seeing this through?
When you tie your stomach into knots that you don't know how to undo
But do you ever have another moment after that, when you can see
There's no one way this has to be? Or maybe that's just me

[Chorus]
Have you felt a little off today
Had a lot to say
But wound up talking to yourself?
I've been hunting for a kindly ear
But couldn't find one near
And wound up talking to myself

[Outro]

Chemical Angel

[Verse 1]
I got a year's supply of capsules (capsules)
I got a bottle full of friends (full of friends, full of friends, full of friends)
They're always right around (around)
To come show me the town (the town)
Delivered through a filtered lens
My doctor says I'm being reckless (reckless)
That quitting's risky for my health (and I'll fuck up my life real bad)
But if I had to choose (to choose)
I know I'd rather lose my life
Than have to lose myself

[Chorus]
Chemical angel
Comfort I crave
Comfort I crave
Comfort I crave
Don't come around no more
I'm already saved
I'm already saved
I'm already saved

[Verse 2]
I'd like us to spend some alone time (just you and me)
But if I slide into a zone (down and then down, down and then down, down and then down, and then down, and then down, and then down)
Don't take it personal (please don't)
You gotta understand
My brain has got a mind of its own
I don't know if I'm close to drowning (deeper than anybody on the planet has ever been under the sea)
Or if I'm finally free (gotta get up and fly, get up so high, I'ma get up higher than a speeding bullet up in the sky)
I touch my artery (and watch)
And watch my fingertips bob up and down like buoys at sea

[Chorus]
Chemical angel
Comfort I crave
Comfort I crave
Comfort I crave
Don't come around no more
I'm already saved
I'm already saved
I'm already saved

[Verse 1]
And the clouds are red and pink like they're wearing a tube of lipstick
The sun is dimming while dipping a toe into the Pacific
Just gimme a hot jacuzzi
A spliff and we'll watch a movie
I'm spiffy, man in a jiffy I'm lifted and living groovie

[Chorus]
I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
I don't need the whole pie
Just wanna have my little slice

[Verse 2]
I found the fountain of youth and went skinny dipping up in it
I pick up the lucky pennies, epiphanies every minute
I run the money to Coinstar and with the cash from the ticket
I snatch my homies whatever they want at Denny's and kick it
'Til the mothafuckin' Sun rise
So many folks I love right here
But it hasn't been a good night
Until the shit gets kinda weird

[Verse 3]
I got a stylish private island inside of my mind the size of Hawaii
And when I'm vibing you're likely to find me deep in my psyche
Hiding out peeping a flying V of neon pelicans filling the psychedelic horizon like
Wow, what just happened?
I'll please have what he is having
And how can I come ride that wave?

[Chorus]
I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
I don't need the whole pie
Just wanna have my little slice
I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
And I just want my slice
(just want my slice pretty please)

[Verse 4]
Don't give a damn if I'm damp, I dance in the rain
I decided to celebrate like the sky is dumping champagne on me
Paint every clap of thunder as Heaven popping a bottle
Jump in and paddle the deepest puddles
Strap on my goggles
I gotta seek what I lack
When I'm weak, gotta act
I'm a freak, it's a fact
But I can't say that I mind
Gotta leave those thoughts behind
And I hop in my car and I bob in my seat
When I'm dropping the beat as I mob the beach
And I stop and I park at the top of a cliff in the dark
And I'm digging on the stars in the sea
Shining like a fistful of diamonds
That somebody went and threw into the sky but they ricochet off
And a couple of 'em fell into the water and they sink the bottom
And I think that I saw some
But I blink and lost 'em
And I drink in the awesome view
Infinite kilometers of water and the tiny ships moving across 'em
If I'm getting money then I get it while I can
But if I'm not, I better live it up and dammit I demand
To give it every single breath I got inside of me and try to be the man

[Chorus]
I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
I don't need the whole pie
Just wanna have my little slice
I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
And I just want my slice






Springtime in New York

[Verse 1]
Mister Softee's back
The block under attack
Frozen Mickey Mouse head massacre
Mac cherry matte glossed lips smack
Please mind the thigh gap
Pierced venus fly trap
French kiss french roast french toast light frap
French-goodbye the nightcap
Full Japanese sleeves
Brazilian hair weaves and bazillionaire thieves
Heavenly heavily creased Canal Street queen
25 if a fiend
Maybe 40 if she's clean
Shorty in black, Nightmare Before Christmas, ripped, safety-pinned jeans
Obscenely scene art crowd
Bean-to- bar-insert- fart-sound
Far out, daddy-o
Daddy issues
Data dumpster
Dumb on purpose
Optimistic prophylactic purchase
Swipe right, minimal hesitation
Possible digital penetration
Popsicle in the butthole?
Wait—where are you going?
Wait. Wait. Please wait. Wait!
My safeword is "safeword"
Say word if that's hot
Word
Not!
What?
Stop! how much you fuckin' got?
Lay up off your cash, your pants, and throw the Her Pleasure trojans on the top!
Drop, kiss the pavement, spread your mothafucking cheeks and make em talk
"wawawawawah"
The familiar wa-wa- walk of shame
Glittering city of dreams
Sex is on the breeze
Must be springtime in the city


Pink Lemonade

[Verse 1]
Air salad
Sex vinaigrette
Intravenous internet
Jazz cigarettes
Blasé frenzy
Officer friendly
Venti Trapaccino
Gluten free Henny
Crocodile skin in the Bentley
Graveyard shift at the Denny's
North side plenty, south side pennies
I vote Yeezus / Deez Nuts 2020
You want to run a country? That makes me shiver
Bitch I wouldn't trust you to run with adult scissors
Flushed ass face, flash that cash
Your fleshlight wouldn't let you smash
Collection plate passing through the church benches
Pastors pull up to their chapels in Benzes
I guess that I musta missed class that day
It's so senseless, baby please pass that J

[Chorus]
How do you make pink lemonade?
(Pink lemons!)
How do you make pink lemonade?
(Pink lemons!)
Is it real? (Yeah!)
Is it real? (Yeah!)
Good! We only want it if it's real!

[Verse 2]
Can't bear a bear market with a bare body
Rich heir—hot air choking errbody
They swore you'd soar, check your sore body
See the sweat pour from each pore of your poor body
Someone wise once wrote
"Our world's divided into two types of folk
Now there's the type of people who divide the world into different types of people
And then there's the type who don't"
My uniters, crack a beer on the couch
If we're not eye to eye I'm hearing you out
And my dividers, get your center-part ready
'Cause I'll divide your skull with a dull machete
We don't play
Fetch or rollover
No way— it's the cold shoulder
For Machiavellian, Martin Skhrelian suit and tie soldiers

[Chorus]
How do you make pink lemonade?
(Pink lemons!)
How do you make pink lemonade?
(Pink lemons!)
Is it real? (Yeah!)
Is it real? (Yeah!)
Good! We only want it if it's real!

[Outro Verse]
Uh oh, uh oh
I lost my ticket to go to the gun show
I was gonna be front row
My mind it used to be sharper than CutCo
Uh oh, uh oh
Somebody came at me cutthroat
Broke open my dome and grafitti'd inside on the stucco
Fuck no
I'm gonna shine like DayGlo
We gotta show 'em how the locals who come from the Bay go
Beethoven lovers or Juggalos chugging a Faygo
Welcome
Got a caseload of queso
No filet mignon but plenty of steak and potato
Pay no attention to henchmen, okay bro?
No way Jose Canseco
If I'm a shark I'm not your Great White I'm maybe a Mako
Makeover, without taking over some shit not a day go by

Don't Be Nice

[Verse]
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice

My policy is to call 'em as I see 'em, no filler
Quality people lift me up like the Colosseum pillars

Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice

Some go from pitching religion to sipping on kombucha
Politicians switching positions like it's the Kama Sutra

Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice
Don't be nice

Our narcissism has got us caught up like bars in prison
Claim we're winning gargling seven dicks and a jar of jizzum
Your momma's a true beauty
Butt makes me weep, I call it a "boo-hooty"
Truly a hot mom
Other moms are doing their squats wrong
And if you don't dig it when I spit it like an open spigot and I'm doing my duty
To drop bombs

False modesty is a guilty habit
Some people simply have it
But the fact is I would not have spent a decade doing this
If I did not believe I was at least tiny bit ridiculously filthy at it
Wrote a book to branch out
After tour let's have a singalong and camp out
'Cause I came here for a single reason
And that's for friendship
And for drinking 'til I can't count—now
If you're Jesus then we break bread
If you're Beavis then we butt heads
If you're a butthead, or a fake friend
I smack ya back to Hollywood, enough said
Skin cream jars
Thin teen stars
Wanna hear a laugher?
A white rapper walks into 16 bars
I am large, I contain multitudes
I'm in charge of a strange cult of dudes
Infinity versions of me in parallel universes from total teddy bear to ultra rude
True, I don't measure power by bravado, libido
Or by popping bottles with Hefner in the grotto in speedos
I'm never sharing my moscato if you suck like mosquito
So "open up" said the taco to the burrito, motherfucker
Don't be nice, don't be nice
Drop all the fuckery, stop it you ugly ignoramus
Don't be nice, don't be—rude and brainless
Don't be—super basic
Don't—move if you're contagious
Don't be nice—la-la- la-la- la
Don't be nice—I'm not listening
Don't be nice, don't be nice
Got nothing nice to say then—don't be nice
Gather the wicked to sacrifice
Sucking the dick of the antichrist
Kicking the bucket is vital to life I know that's the price
Don't be—candy striped
Don't be—parasites
Don't—do me dirty
Don't—think you're worthy
Don't—hurt me
Mercy is not a courtesy currently that occurs to me
I turn up eternally, you will not stop it
True—my crew hotter than hot pockets
(This dude Watsky too cocky, let's cock block it)
We do what we do because it's true to us
While few puppets in suits up at the top profit
And if you got a new coup then I do not knock it
But I bukkake your Bugati with snot rockets

Yes Brittania

[Chorus]
I’m pleading guilty with the Crown today
That’s all I got to say
I will not lie to you
I had to try my luck across the sea
Now we’re history
I’m saying goodbye to you

[Verse 1]
Yes, I’ve been a mess
With the pressure the stress
See ya never, I guess
Nevertheless, finding you I was blessed
Swear I’m trying my best
Lion inside of my chest
Trying to claw his way out
Crack my ribs, pop my lungs
I don’t know if there’s a safe route
Now—we can cut this frayed rope
Or hope and wait us to fade
Babe— after how great the ups were
We can’t be living with love when it’s lost its luster
Frosted over, busted, exhausted, ruptured
Another couple who settled for less
We want something real
A relationship
Wanna feel
And quit chasing shit
Gimme a shield
Or she’ll break me quick
And we will never be the same again

[Chorus]
I’m pleading guilty with the Crown today
That’s all I got to say
I will not lie to you
I had to try my luck across the sea
Now we’re history
I’m saying goodbye to you

[Verse 2]
All we’re seekin’s a person that we can cherish
I don’t think you really want a green card marriage
Nothing is fair but you’re caring and can’t bear it
A lot of people perished tonight in Paris
The planet is a mean motherfucker
You wanna scream but we gotta lean on each other
We suffer and pick ourselves up off of the floor
Your dad at stage four, what could I say to support?
Can we just quit each other
The way you did cigarettes?
Up and split, cold turkey, no regrets?
I’d even miss tasting the nicotine on your breath when we kiss
I’m not ready to say good bye to you yet
Like sayonara
I don’t know if I can try tomorrow
Am I supposed to say a hallelujah
Smile I knew ya
And go on my way?

[Chorus]
I’m pleading guilty with the Crown today
That’s all I got to say
I will not lie to you
I had to try my luck across the sea
Now we’re history
I’m saying goodbye to you

[Outro]
Oh, yes Brittania
I surrender
Book me and toss the key
Oh, yes Brittania
I’ll remember your generosity
Oh, yes Brittania
Poison testers, princes and hooligans
Oh, yes Brittania
Love's a jester, and what a fool I’ve been
Love Letters

[Verse 1]
The drum is never the enemy of the pen
But when I’m meeting mentally with beat and melody then
One of me can turn into ten of me
If there’s ten of me, tell me how many heavenly similes can we blend?
Like women and men would fall with no friends
Like a rose would fall with no stem
Like most folks follow trends
Like Os follow LMNs
That’s how well I know life flows with the elements
As sunrise kills an evening
As stars die and a night sky is grieving
As man sees what he has when it’s leaving
You gone is as asthma to breathing
That’s how much I need you in my life
I’m never gonna ever leave you in my lifetime
Cause every time I hear line that shows me I’m not alone it’s saving me
Cause I know that that’s a lifeline
Like minds—this is our home and they won’t ruin it easily
Cause the wolf is gonna blow until he’s blue in the cheek
And me and you and the crew can go take a snooze in the street
And the bulldozer can come chew on our feet
We never let em through
We’ll build a levy
Limit the river’s level
Steady the flood and begin with a pebble
Lend me one syllable
Come if you’re ready to shovel
Run if you’re shaking
But I know that today is not my Waterloo

[Chorus]
You’ve made a place where I’m welcome
And although I give voice to it seldom
Know I love you
Nobody’s above you
And if you love someone then you tell them

[Verse 2]
Every day the planet’s losing IQ points
But people still bumping Ice Cube joints
So I’ve got hope
And every day I’m seeking my true voice and looking up at a bright new choice
Cause everybody’s got a hustle and everyone’s trying to push it
It’s tricky to find the kush hiking up a mountain of bullshit
And there’s another mountain of bullshit next to it littered with glitter, money
And strippers they’re selling as good shit
It’s nothing new up at the core though
Everything same as it’s always been only more so
Of course so same token, while there’s life there is truth
While there’s truth it demands to be spoken
And someone’s gonna speak it
It’s really not a secret
You just need to search it
You just need to seek it
And though we like to worship a genius in a coffin
We often forget that there’s prophets among us walking
And I know because I hear em when I am in the clouds
And I got my music up and jamming it loud
And dammit whatever I am or could ever become I’m positive that I will always be a fan in the crowd
So gimme gimme gimme
Dylan and Biggy
Hit me with Jimi, Emily Dickinson, Eminem, Niki Giovanni, Lennon, Kendrick, Gambino, Rafa, Chinaka, Dahlak and Missy, Saul and Beau and Paul and Kweli, Chali 2na and Chance and Seneca

[Hook]
Go in poet!
'86 I was thrown in the mix, saying
Go in poet!
86 anyone who would stand in the path of a kid saying
Go in poet!
86 bitches, 86 cups full of lean
Go in poet!
86 bars, infinity ways to say what I mean

[Chorus]
You’ve made a place where I’m welcome
And although I give voice to it seldom
Know I love you
Nobody’s above you
And if you love someone then you tell them

[Verse 3]
So if you’re blocking the future I wanna to walk toward
Suit yourself we’re gonna lock swords
But it’s a wash if you’re saying “Watsky I could rock withcha if you didn’t talk
Like some nails on a chalkboard
I can tell—that you’re really on your dope writer tip
But you’ll trip if you don’t try to fit
Maybe you can make it if you ghostwrite a hit
And sell it to somebody who can ghostride a whip”
Shieeet—I say no sirree
I can smell the weak shit through the potpourri
So I’m just gonna do what I do
You take a minute or two and Google Tim and Magoo
I love the life that I picked even if it ain't plush
I’m too glad to complain much
I’m in the lab in a drab world
While these fuckers dab and do dabs and I dab on my pad with my paintbrush
This is for the kids whipping up some home-cooked
Spitting 86 bars, fuckin no hook
Lying in the grass
Passion in their chest
And a ballpoint pressed in their notebook
Listen to me, this is for the word
Looking so fine I’m rubbing coconut oil up in the crack of that spine
This is for the times I’m reminded my mind isn’t mine alone
This is for the poems and the lines
(And the letters in em)



Stick to Your Guns

[Verse 1: Watsky]
I’ll be gone when you read this so I just wanted to say
I’m sorry to the couple decent people who got in the way
And maybe there was a point at which this all could have been different
But this is the position we’re in and it’s pointless to wish that it isn’t
They'll all be gawking when I walk in the door
Cocking my shotgun hammer and they drop to the floor
The clocks shatter I scatter the jock horde and splatter the chalkboard
It matters a lot more, than half of you thought
When you were knocking me like I’m a laughingstock
And a weakling a freak and creep, I was mocked and ignored
You’re sorry now but talk is cheap-- shoulda thought it before
You’re the sorry flock of sheep who made me rot to the core
And of course you’ll make a break to escape through the corridor
Don’t be late— I’ll set you up on a date with the coroner
And our fate’s are sealed, all of you fakes
Don't worry, this will all be over soon
[Chorus: Watsky + Julia Nunes]
You got your finger on the trigger, kid
You got your finger on the trigger, kid
Line it up, line it up, line it up
And hit me with the truth
You got your finger on the trigger, kid
You got your finger on the trigger, kid
Line it up, line it up, line it up
And hit me with the truth

[Verse 2: Watsky]
Thanks for tuning into the top-rated crew in the news
Feels great to us that we’re the one that viewers would choose
I’m hearing through my producer
We’ve got the scoop on the name and the favorite food of the shooter
Plus an interview with a student
Who’s been fed through a tube— she was shot in the head
We’re gonna bring you a segment live from her hospital bed
We’ll try to bring you the spin through your preexisting opinions
But if we miss it switch it to our sister network instead
Of course we know this situation is tragic
But take a minute to appreciate our fabulous graphics
And we’ll be back in action with up to the second reports
After a couple of words from all our loyal sponsors of course
So like us, vine us, and tweet to connect
24/7 we’re giving ya what you’re craving
We live to deliver live the kinda coverage that you’ve come to expect
We’re always here for you

[Chorus: Watsky + Julia Nunes]
You got your finger on the trigger, kid
You got your finger on the trigger, kid
Line it up, line it up, line it up
And hit me with the truth
You got your finger on the trigger, kid
You got your finger on the trigger, kid
Line it up, line it up, line it up
And hit me with the truth

[Bridge: Julia Nunes]
Stick to your guns
Stick to your guns
Stick to your guns
Stick to your guns

[Verse 3: Watsky]
We come together in this hour of need
To honor the innocent victims of this cowardly deed
Of course I share your sentiment as your voice in the Senate
But let’s accept nothing ever could have been done to prevent it
It’s just the strange inner visions of a deranged individual
Full of rage, full of hate, full of vitriol
I gotta mention that it’s sick and insane
My opponent’s twisting your pain for political gain
That’s lame
And I think it’s a damn shame
It doesn’t give anyone power to cast blame
Because the past is the past, and it’s best that we keep things the same
So my Chads and my Staceys, go back to the mall
Fill your bags out at Macy’s and chat in the hall
And I hope I’m that vote that you cast in the fall
'Cause I care for you, it’s true


Brave New World

[Intro]
Veneficia!
Veneficia!
Seven trumpets!
Veneficia!

[Verse 1]
Easy, with a ballot, we can put a reality TV personality in DC
Speak free if you can see how this delicate fucking matter developed but, man, it beats me! (Oh my Gooood!)
Two fleets keep peace on the mean streets
One treats brown people like they’re beastly
Nothing like the force that police me (That’s so oooodd!)
What’s the fate of the species?
Get a metal plate and then mate with the PCs
Or retreat back to a monkey chucking feces?
(What’s the deeeeal?) Wanna ease this pain
Different than the BC years
Now we BCC Jesus on the email chain
Way too many threats to flee
Way too many heads to feed
Not too many beds to sleep
Chief said that it was best you leave
"F you, please" to the refugees
And it’s seeming like it’s every other day that I been tugging at my collar, thinking, “Damn, it’s toasty!”
Where did all the people at the supermarket go
That used to scan my groceries? Vanished mostly
And wassup with all the homies with the camo and the ammo in the rifles on their shoulder
Walking through the city, thinking that they’re Annie Oakley?
That’s quite enough
But this shit is fucking unbelievable
I swear you couldn’t write this stuff

[Chorus]
Everywhere that I stare (Veneficia!)
You couldn’t write this shit, no
Every minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)
Another fantasy is brought to life
Everywhere that I stare (Science Fiction!)
You couldn’t write this shit, no
Every minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)
And now I never get surprised

[Verse 2]
Young George Jetson stepping up in this motherfucker
Gripping a butcher knife, hoping I can cut the chord
Where the horde is plugged to the motherboard
That is not a legitimate hoverboard (Shit’s got wheels!)
I Iook at the sky, saying “My God, run!”
Life’s heavier than an iPod one
My Twitter ain’t gonna matter when the tripods come
(Let’s get real!) From the hieroglyphs to the crowded malls
Never mind the if, but the how it falls
I’m vibing out watching Ow! My Balls (Oh yeaaaah)
Core defects tend to wreck my sleep
The quest to be more perfect than Ford Prefect
While I’m dreaming of Electric Sheep
‘Cause Soylent Green is people, resistance is just futile
Pop a red pill and a blue pill and I dilate my pupils
Moving light speed, we all got vile needs
Living is a violent deed
Spread my soul like Wild Seed
Why would it be any wonder I act weird?
I’m trying to find out who the fuck I am
While looking in a cracked Black Mirror
You got a finish what you thought about?
How this is gotta bottom out?
You wanna flee the reaper, but they’re bombing the city
And the single haven to creep in is the slaughterhouse

[Chorus]
Everywhere that I stare (Veneficia!)
You couldn’t write this shit, no
Every minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)
Another fantasy is brought to life
Everywhere that I stare (Seven trumpets!)
You couldn’t write this shit, no
Every minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)
And now I never get surprised
Everywhere that I stare (Veneficia!)
You couldn’t write this shit, no
Every minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)
Another fantasy is brought to life
Everywhere that I stare (Veneficia!)
You couldn’t write this shit, no
Every minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)
And now I never get surprised


Going Down

[Chorus]
I’m going down
I’m going down
I’m going down
On you

[Verse 1]
I’m breathing deep then I leap in
I’m going under
Like eating that V’s the key to how we can beat global hunger
Achieve total peace on earth
I’m a freak, I’m a local wonder
More lung capacity than Freddie Mercury vocal numbers
I plunder the briny deep
A spelunker plunging in, hunkering down in between those puffy pink walls
Like a fallout bunker
And if I never emerge to the surface don’t gimme shit
In twenty years I’m back like Kimmy Schmidt (wassup)
Hold up, wait (Hold up, wait)
Cause I really gotta set one thing straight
I’m not chowing on the chocha so that you’ll reciprocate
I just go in (go in)
No strings (no strings)
Tastes great (tastes great)
Fun times (vitamins!)
I got a wand tongue
I’m doing sorcery
If you don’t want none
Well that’s just more for me

[Chorus]
I’m going down
I’m going down
On you

[Verse 2]
I’m going down on you like I like it but bruh I’m lyin’
Cause I don’t like it, I love it that shit’s my valentine
One tiny warning—I’m dining on your gourmet form until the morning
Performing like it’ll stop global warming
My palate has got no equal
Talent could vanquish evil
And maybe make Rick Moranis be in the Ghostbusters sequel
One taste and I’m wailing “god bless!” (god bless!)
Until you quiver I will not rest (not rest)
Licking repeatedly like your beaver’s a square reader
And my tongue is a VISA debit card that failed to process
It’s like the Miracle Worker and I’m blind and I’m deaf and dumb
Plus each inch of my body’s numb except for the tip of my tongue
And each Wikipedia topic’s printed in microscopic raised ink on your clit
So the single option I got to know something about this wonderful globe that
We come from so locate your swollen bean and then probe the folds of it
Fiendishly til you cum about infinity times
And baby that isn’t a crime

[Chorus]
I’m going down
I’m going down
I’m going down
On you
[Verse 3]
Given our planet’s gender ratio
It’d be a mockery glossing over fellatio (there he go)
Meaning that really fucking quick
I gotta touch on sucking dick
Many guys visualize giving BJs and say “eww”
But can we just please give smoking pole a calm objective view?
I’m pretty straight, but I’ll state: sexuality’s an arc
Maybe I can suck a flashlight so my soul will not be dark
Why couldn’t I get sexual with a man at all?
At thirteen I was in my bedroom fucking stuffed animals
If I can bang an inanimate object can’t I jam the crotch of a man in my jaw and softly massage it?
Fellas vomit like “what if the sausage is smelling hella funky?”
Don’t you wash your fucking junk, B?
Of course I wouldn’t devour icky salami
But that goes the same for encountering stinky punani
So in this scenario where I brush my teeth with a penis
Let’s assume that the penis we’re dealing with sparkles the cleanest of all
Penis penis on the wall
With those well proportioned balls

[Chorus]
I’m going down
I’m going down
I’m going down
I’m going down
I’m going down
Down, down, down
I’m going down

[Verse 4]
So let’s say you’re okay with your lips around a cock
But you still can’t wrap your mind around the final moneyshot
Don’t give up! If the nut is what truly makes it foul
Then just get him close to busting and hand him a paper towel
Yup! No gravy on your chin!
Yup! Everybody wins!
Yup! Squirrel to an acorn
Dudes like to look at dicks in their straight porn
Put your hands up if you got hangups
Put your hands up if you got hangups
If I could get with it I’d have a wider ocean I’m fishing in
But I’m inhibited by my social conditioning
So where my head’s at present the odds are gloomy
That I would agree to feast on a D that’s presented to me
But I’m not officially ruling out
That at some point in my life I’ll have a dingaling in my mouth

Midnight Heart

[Chorus: Mal Devisa]
Well I’ve made enemies along the ride
I’m afraid I could never be satisfied
But each way that I turn I face ahead

[Refrain: Mal Devisa]
Straight through to your midnight heart
Straight through to your midnight heart
Now you know your soul is dark
Straight through to your midnight heart

[Verse 1: Watsky]
You don’t know the name of like half of these folks
And they’ll be sprinting for the exit the minute you’re broke
A bunch of bobblehead muppets to laugh at your jokes
Wipe your ass and come and give your ego a stroke
I had to break it to you
Sorry buddy, it was time you knew
Nothing you ever said was funny, man the punchline’s you
One time for the palm trees and the sunshine
Two times for the two-timers being unkind
Confined to a small mind, but the fault’s mine
I always keep on crawling back across the San Andreas faultline
I keep on climbing underground to sweat out all my principles in darkness with you in this salt mine
Where we’re all blind, I should fall back, I know all signs say that I should halt
But I golf clap for this false crap
But from now on counterfeit suckers suck on my ballsack
(Alright?)

[Refrain: Mal Devisa]
Straight through to your midnight heart
Straight through to your midnight heart
Now you know your soul is dark
Straight through to your midnight heart

[Chorus: Mal Devisa]
Well I’ve made enemies along the ride
I’m afraid I could never be satisfied
But each way that I turn I face ahead

[Bridge: Mal Devisa]
I know you know it’s way too late now and your soul is dark
Yeah motherfucker I see through you to your midnight heart
Straight through, straight through
Through-through-through to your midnight heart
Now you know, now you know
Straight through to your h-h-h-h-heart

[Verse 2: Watsky]
It’s tough to care about stupid bullshit all of the time
So I gotta say I’m glad that’s your job and not mine
Everybody’s got a topic at the top of their mind
A choice of how you wanna let your life be defined
(Is it honeys?) Sleeping around is your taste?
(Is it money?) Are you the paper you chase?
(Kinda funny) You said that I’ve been playing it safe
You got the bravest voice, say that to my face
(Is it your career?) Pretty shitty to hear
But I took a difficult look in the mirror
And I checked in the rearview
Objects are never what they appear
The past tends to look crooked from here
The mask that I put on out of fear
The tracks that I didn’t put out
The facts that I kept out of my ear
The slack that I cut people who didn’t deserve it is tragically clear
No, no, no, not this year

[Bridge: Watsky and Mal Devisa]
I’m not done changing yet
I’ll get these old knees checked
I can’t bend over for someone I don’t respect

[Chorus: Mal Devisa]
Well I’ve made enemies along the ride
I’m afraid I could never be satisfied
But each way that I turn, I look ahead


Conversations

[Verse 1]
I remember vividly
My tears dropping on the grey carpet on the top step
Pops giving me his best guess
Me confessing the burning question stressing and concerning me and
Turning me to a wet mess
It’s probably nothing
I get it, I’m aware
I know it’s probably stupid to be scared
But these days are flying past us and nobody seems to care
It’s like we’re sprinting towards a brick wall we’re pretending isn’t there
What happens when we hit it?
Do we split into a million bits
Or do we come back as a bullfrog and talk in ribbits?
What is it? What is it?
You got the answer so give it, so give it, so give it
Don’t lie, what happens when we die?
Dad says, Georgie I’m just guessing from what I’ve been told
Probably thinking, “How’d I raise this emo fucking nine-year- old?”
Since I’m sorta really not religious it’s a crapshoot
I roll a pair of dice
Although the thought of paradise is very nice
In my heart I know I don’t believe in magic
So I’m thinking maybe death is like eternal TV static
Or returning to the state before your birth
Absorbed into the earth
The fewer hours left the more they’re worth
I admit that it’s difficult to think about
I think everybody got a little bit of doubt
You don’t get to hide from it even if you shout
Not a soul on the planet gets to wiggle out
And he said that I know that’s it’s tough to take in son but it’s so early
I can see you’re in a hurry but don’t worry cause

[Chorus]
That isn’t for a long, long time
That isn’t for a long, long time
That isn’t for a long, long time
That isn’t for a long, long, long, long time

[Verse 2]
Life moves fast
Made the mistake of blinking, twenty years passed
Now I’m sitting in my living room in Brooklyn with my father
We don’t bother doing Christmas in the Bay any longer
It’s first time that we’ve had this conversation
He says “It’s tough to take in
I know we’re not quite ancient
But we’ve reached age where we should probably talk arrangements
We could take it several routes
We could sell the house
We can’t work forever, eventually money will run out
That’s a spot taking a loan would help us cover
Which would make it tougher to leave something for you and your brother”
Stop—can’t you see?
Every meal that you paid for me
All this power to chase a dream
All this privilege not to crave riches
But it’s plain to me the key fact is it’s easy to act like cash means jack shit if
You never lacked it
And the greatest honor I could have is to make a buck and pass back a
Fraction of all the happiness you gave to me
And I will never make you live where you don’t aim to be
Age is just data
We paint our story A to Z then dip out
R.I.P. rip out, we tear out the pages
Tear up the stage and we take a seat
Making a vacancy
Famous or not, we fade from the plot
Every day when a new night falls
I ride around the sun on this big blue ball
I get a bit further from the kid called Paul
And I get a bit closer to the big brick wall
But since inching up to that fence
I can run my fingers against all the bricks and mortar and sense
That it’s not so cold and so dense
And although I’m mournful I’ve known that I’m not immortal
I’m not banging into stone but I’m more heading through this portal
We’re born to return to home we’re all born to be mincemeat
Everything dies except for Papaya King hotdogs on 86th St
Dad hands me a napkin tells me it’s been the same since the fifties
He didn’t always love the city but dammit he’ll miss me
How can you miss something after you leave, I agree that it’s sad, but please
Don’t dwell on it Dad, because—

[Chorus]
That isn’t for a long, long time
That isn’t for a long, long time
That isn’t for a long, long time
That isn’t for a long, long, long, long time


Knots

[Verse 1]
What a tangle
What a strangling knot to be caught in
To be exiled here
To be stuck in Berlin with Vienna so near
Yet so far from the Emperor’s ear
What a strange and impossible sum
To be old while to still be so young
To have sung before speaking a word
To be heard
To be hailed
Then to fail
To be done
To love but to be so naive
To trust and to be so deceived
To mourn, forlorn, to be torn from you
Scorned for another who suffers no grief
To curse God, seeking lightning
And to still be ignored
To hide in this room, now too rich to afford
To hear armies of creditors bang at the door
Always yelling for more
And to have nothing to sell that could help
Except for the Steinway that sits in the corner

[Verse 2]
For Arthur it all came too easily
To learn the scales in every key
To play the etudes and the suites
The nocturnes and The Fantaisie
To master the sonatas, minuets, and symphonies
To seek the truth in fits and starts
To strike the middle F like it’s an arrow through the heart
To wing the right hand like a dove (the peaceful flutter of a dove)
And with left a violent shove (some moments will demand a shove)
To needle gently yet relentless with a steady foot upon the pedal
And to clench the iron first inside the velvet glove
To learn to whisper and to scream
(the whisper justifies the scream)
To let each yearning finger breathe
(no, nothing lives unless it breathes)
To burn, to worship, to mislead
To pose a question with a pinky on a key
To flee, to fight, to bleed
To float in air
Nothing solid underneath
To rap those heavy knuckles on the gate to heaven til there’s nothing to
Achieve, but—
To go retrieve the length of cable hidden in the cabinet
To metamorphosize the twisted rope unto an alphabet
To lay the lazy C upon the shabby wooden floor to rest
To send the end across the top to bend the C into an S
To curve the tail beneath the S to turn the tangle to a B
To hug the wretched root around the fibers suffocatingly
To wrap again to wrap again to give the coil seven loops
To penetrate the yawning hoop
To tug the loose appendage through
To yank the knot until it’s ready for the job it’s got to do
To toss the braid above the ceiling beam and to affix the noose
To bid adieu to all of you until there’s nothing left to do but
Climb the chair
To cinch the collar
Find the edge
To step into the air

Roses

[Chorus]
Don’t let my ghost drag you down
If you don’t see me around
It doesn’t mean that I fell
Yeah I’m doing well
I got some roses to smell
I hope you smile when I’m gone
It means I had the strength to move on
To find another story to tell
To answer the bell
I got some roses to smell
[Verse 1]
When magic’s happening my habit’s been coiling up a memory and trappin it right
In the cavity of my ribs, like the doors of a cabinet might
But you won’t hold onto a shadow just by grabbing it tight
Set it free and let it back in the light
Never out of my heart, even when out of my sight
Leaving is s'posed to be hard
Man I thought it so was selfish of people I love to keep falling out of my life
But now I know
No I don’t take it personal
If you got a really lovely place to go
I will chase my goals, yeah, to make me whole
Cause it’s urgent we love and be loved
I’ve begun to scrub up with detergent to shine up my soul

[Chorus]
Don’t let my ghost drag you down
If you don’t see me around
It doesn’t mean that I fell
Yeah I’m doing well
I got some roses to smell
I hope you smile when I’m gone
It means I had the strength to move on
To find another story to tell
To answer the bell
I got some roses to smell

[Verse 2]
Cause every screen that we tap is screaming that bigger is better
Better is how you make yourself matter
But matter is fleeting
Am I living to feed a machine that I’m blind to see?
No point in hiding my pride if there’s no privacy
I’ve already dedicated too much of my time to trying to get my followers up
And crying out for attention
And sleeping around to mend a hollow crater inside of me
Knowing well that it don’t mean shit
Going to the well for another cheap dopamine hit
I’m done being a bitch to ambition
I’m already rich
I got a head that’s full of million dollar questions
And the length of it
Is I don’t need the courage to work
I want the strength to quit

[Chorus]
Don’t let my ghost drag you down
If you don’t see me around
It doesn’t mean that I fell
Yeah I’m doing well
I got some roses to smell
I hope you smile when I’m gone
It means I had the strength to move on
To find another story to tell
To answer the bell
I got some roses to smell


Theories

[Verse]
Arthur stepped off, yeah he stepped offa the chair
Couldn’t weigh a hundred forty pounds
And the rope snapped, yeah, the rope snapped
And then Arthur found himself looking up from the ground
Looking up, looking up, found things looking up
Looking up, looking not so down, no not so down
No knots don’t have to stay that way
No, not so tightly wound

What a lovely thing it is to fail
To release those grasping fingernails
Arthur thought the end was near
Then Arthur played for fifty years
And then my father walked down 8th and 57th street to
Carnegie Hall, yeah it was Carnegie Hall
The show was past sold out for weeks
But they said “if you don’t mind, if you don’t mind sitting on stage
Sometimes we release a couple seats”
Twenty feet, twenty feet, yeah my dad’s twenty three
Twenty feet from the hands on the keys
Yeah, the hands on the keys of a man with the hands that almost didn’t exist
That almost didn’t exist to see

Back in '97 when Dad was my chauffeur
He’d play the radio and I’d try to guess the composer
Chopin sprinkled over the hum of the motor
When I was young I'd never doubt my composure
Everything’s kosher, man I was so sure
I’d say that I’m good (I'm good)
Don’t want no adulthood
I never understood
Couldn’t get how anyone would ever want to end to their life
Until the day that I could
I’ve heard it said we’re alone in the ether
That we’re the only intelligent creatures
So you don’t need to adjust your receivers
If they were out there they’d be texting us, hitting our beepers
Invading us on some alien Julius Caesar
Or begging “take me to your leader”
But I got a theory it’s neither
That there’s a billion brilliant alien planets at leisure
Smoking alien reefer
The evolution of the mind’s not the hunger to conquer
Or to want or to seek or to wander
Or even wonder, but to simply to be
Until we cease to be any longer
There’s nothing wrong with heavy eyelids
I hope you enjoyed my twenties as much as I did
You’ll never know how much that all of you provided
And I’m gonna try to do the same for my k-


Exquisite Corpse

[Intro]
Have you ever seen a corpse?
How about an exquisite one?
Think about Frankenstein’s monster
Now think about fun
You’re getting it, good!
Johnny starts with a leg. I sew on an arm. Then you lend a hand
We each add our piece
Now, what kind of beast have we made?
Let’s find out!

[Verse 1: Watsky]
I woke up Sunday to a bloodshot sky
Robot overlords goose step by
Shoulda listened when we had the juice to try
And Bill the Science Guy told us that “the end is nigh!”
Lately it’s been getting harder to
Survive, since the Hive started to
Ban American refugees from being a damn part of the
People’s Republic of Antarctica
A bum begged me for a bill he could borrow
Babbling some shit about “there’s still a tomorrow”
He said that “legend has it, there’s still a Baja Grill and a Sbarro
At the top of Mount Kilimanjaro”
And so desperate, I set out from the deserts out in Portland
Until my thirsty horse collapsed in the scorched sand
I promised to myself heart and soul
I’d crawl across this dead world for those garlic rolls

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
Yo, kid, let go of the dead horse
Stop crying, need a ride? Hop in my red Porsche
Eat something homie, you look bony and frail
Now why the hell would you take the Oregon Trail?
Remember back in grade school, that stupid computer game?
You shoulda known better, now there’s no one but you to blame
Dying of dysentery, don’t climb to the enemy
I’ma take you underground where the hive resistance be
Apparently a colony of people are out there
A garden full of veggies, even garlic they sprout there
Leader General Bieber who be running shit down there
Found a way to end the drought, bring out the swimwear
Soon as we pulled up we heard drilling noises
Children started dancing, even grown folk joined in
Like a hydrant in the Bronx, water shot up in the air
But was boiling and as hot as solar flares

WHAT’S THE MOVE?
Watsky & T-Pain
Talking to Myself

Stick to Your Guns

[Verse 3: Grieves]
Ooowee, ain’t that a bitch?
Nobody believed it 'til the first wave hit
The ground started shaking and the sky went red
(Mayday! Atlanta’s been lost, Justin Bieber is dead)
No! God damn, another one down
Colonies of people living under the ground
Rallied against the clowns, a resistance was born
They fight for mankind and the existence of porn (let’s go!)
Back on the surface life eaters
Avoiding wild packs of North American beavers
Creepers and face feeders
Fearing the great reaper
You’re either gonna get eaten or beat with a pay meter
This is real shit homie, dog eat dog
More like robot clown eats man and whole squad
Graffiti on the wall says “there is no god”
But there is still homemade vodka, and that’s cool

[Verse 4: Wax]
Homemade vodka, pour a shot up then I swill it
I’m the only person left who remembers how to distill it
It’s the most popular product in the underground economy
So I’m the most popular person in my underground colony
All the resistance leaders they throw shots down
In my bar after they fight the robot clowns
As of late they’ve been stressed and depressed
'Cause the chances of us winning are becoming less and less
We lost the captain of the human army
Morale's really low and a lot of people are starving
I’m still wondering how this all happened
Is this even real, or am I just on acid?
The clowns are advancing down
I use the word “down” cause they’re coming underground
Wait—what’s that sound? It’s kinda loud
Holy shit! There they are right now!
[Verse 5: Adam Vida]
Calm down soldier, this is no time to be a fink
We can beat these clowns, okay, we just need to think
I’ve lost ten men this week, I can’t sleep a wink
But this the last place on earth a guy can get a decent drink
So darned if we lose this bar to these useless zombie bastards
I’d rather starve than be boozeless
So I put barbed wire slabs on the fences
That should buy us some time to plan our defenses
Pick up the chairs and trash cans off the floor
Stack 'em up on the front door to jam up the entrance
Ain’t got grenades, but we still might be saved
I just found fifty diet coke cans and some breath mints
Fill the trash cans to the brim with the cola
When the robots break in toss the mints in the soda
See the blast won’t hurt 'em but it’ll get 'em wet certainly
It’ll mess up their wiring and disrupt their circuitry
If it don’t work though, my next plan cannot fail
We drink the vodka—shot after shot 'til we’re too drunk to feel pain
Spark up a flame, and turn the bottles that remain into Molotov cocktails
I’ve had it with you clowns, I’ve reached my limit
You may have killed my captain, but I’m the lieutenant
And I won’t let you terrorize us, wait just a minute
That ain’t no robot zombie, man, what the hell is it?!

[Verse 6: Rafael Casal]
Adam! Ah! I didn't mean to scare ya'
Dude, that’s not a robot, it’s just Iggy Azalea
Musta hid up in the bar to learn about who we are
Then report back to the captain of the folks attackin' my favorite rap stars
Oh shit, quick! Hit her with some fuckin' duck-tape
She came to sing-rap & give us all some undercut fades
Lo-fi beats transmittin telegraphic autotune
Help! She’s inside my head, and I don’t think I am immune
Been repo-d, I think I’m in deep, I am weeping at the seams
Forfeiting my dreams of keepin' the streets G code
Only way to outrun it is doublin' up on the track
Any and everyone get up and meddle I mean it
Just puttin' the pedal into it
Now we taking over the tempo and tunin' it
Never gone let a lesser level ruin it, so I’m inducing it
Doomin it all, I’m undoin' it, deuces I'm dippin
Who comin' with the kid? I’m out
Head to the dojo, Diggs got pistols hidden in his fro though
These robots think we're bitch, Diggs, gimme some loko
And let me borrow your Jefferson robe bro, I’m goin' postal
Bay boy's 'bout to put this barrel into some fuckin' blowholes

[Verse 7: Daveed Diggs]
Whoa whoa whoa, hold up cash
You see I’m trimming my mustache up
I heard all these newly brainwashed rap chicks are really down to fuck
I comb the pistols out the fro and they’re sitting on the table
And there’s two cheesesteaks out in a fully gassed up LeSabre
I’m ready to ride on these haters, let’s go
But you better drive, 'cause you already know
That apocalypse or not when I’m behind the wheel
My black ass is sure enough gonna get stopped
And we ain’t got the time and the tags are expired
You know how it is, I am really not trying to die today, by cop, or by Iggy robot
Whoa, stop, lemme go bottle up this kombucha I’ve been brewing on the back porch
Grab the backpack out the closet, it’s got all of our passports
I’ve been planning this for a minute, seen the writing on the walls
If we survive and find a civilization, they’ve got to know who we are
First we swoop up Chinaka, in case we need some muscle
Or reason, or anything other than our indiscriminate hustle
Then we roll through the hood real slow bumping something all of these monsters know
Like a Watsky song? Lo and behold, they’ll follow our car wherever we go
Let’s lead em out to Napa and let em gentrify that bitch up
Start the car, homie, no, we are not stopping for any swishers
Or a McFlurry, bruh there’s no time for that shit
Hold up, there go Nak right there, pull over
Ayo Nak, Ayo Nak, get in the car!

[Verse 8: Chinaka Hodge]
Ay Rafa, get backseat
Make room for ya fam, friend
I’ll give you this McShake and the end of my Hansen
Now what the fuck y'all talking it’s the end of the world?
I been on Pinterest, tending to the end of my curls
I mean the sky is always purple, people running on vapors
I mean, the Tribune been gone, I ain’t gon read it in the papers
Nothing’s all that different, been the same for black women
When apocalyptic breakfasts follows revelation dinners
The lights been out, the water smelling of Flint
Exquisite corpses laying where the bodies had been
No bombs over Baghdad, just drones with grenades
So when life give us citrus, we learn to drop Lemonade
So, okay, fellas, shall we get in formation?
Bump some pied piper aura up out the trunk of this scraper
Do the end of the world styling in our fitteds and gators
Lure these stupid mufuckas on a goose chase
Use whatever’s already in our suitcase
I got this whole row jones for this open road
And my flow so cold, we don’t need AC
I popped fo’ no doze, I’ll read this formal prose
I bet you Butler knows how to make us free
A Lauren Olamina in a Trumped up world
A black magic woman still being called "girl"
But the only constant is change, holmes
So let’s get the supplies and then dip up out our Bay homes
Got this earthquake kit and six gallons of gas
I got Diggs in the driver and Raf in the back
Got this passenger seat and the last of these sweets
Go north, Daveed, just gun it 'til wine country
Do it moving fluid like turfin' with iDummy
It’s the Bay moves we learned as natives gon' keep us safe
It’s that forty water water and an instrumental tape, let’s go
They’ll get tired behind us
I mean half of 'em hybrid but, nigga, most of them wind-ups
We got nothing but power we got nothing but time
I got Kwudi’s new beats and Music of My Mind
But nothing left in Napa, but the scent of the grapes
No palate-cleansing tapas for discriminate taste
Nothing left in Calistoga but one popped bubble
We got just two dudes and like one Nak, trouble
How the hell we s'posed to repopulate humanity
The two of y’all and me? That’s, like, actual insanity
Like ew, that's really gross, guys
It's like, not Diggs, and not Rafa
Not nobody else, just get back
Just doing it styling in wine country with nothing else

[Verse 9: Watsky]
Red red wine, I don’t want to die!
I hum under my breath as I fight death in the quiet depths of the bunker
I was confounded when I came to after Dumbfoundead
Brought me to the battered base underground where we hunkered down for the summer
But then winter came and the flame that we tended to flickered to nothing
And the few of us living resorted to burning cadavers like tinder and lumber
We bickered bitterly and our wickedness hit a peak in our hunger
Sickened we hunted each other
Pickpocketed the weak and we plundered
A visitor from the surface stole a garlic roll from a Dave and Busters
And I butchered the buster in his sleep just to lick his fingers for butter
But it kind of gave me indigestion, I confess, and the pipes ruptured from my dung
Lungs punctured when Dumb stuck me with the sharpened end of a plunger
Now it’s me and Grieves in a shallow grave
Next to J. Biebs and Azalea’s pale humungous butt
That I rest my head upon for my perpetual slumber
We frail and wretched kvetch and wail
It’s curtains, my days are numbered
And I’m numb to the pain, yet one remaining certainty gives me comfort
I made a living yelling my opinions loudly
Thinking I might matter if I drew a crowd, see
Now, my lily cheek on Iggy’s chilly cheeks
I finally see that the future will be fine without me
Nothing is entitled to be mine
I’m a token of a broken time
And maybe there’s survivors on the surface in LeSabres working on
Tomorrow sipping red, red wine
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, wine

Complaint

Welcome to the Family
Hello, hello, hello, hello (hello, hello, hello, hello)
It's a motherfucking pleasure (it's a motherfucking pleasure)
No pressure, but would you like to blow my mind
And move too fast and plan our perfect lives together? (Plan our perfect lives together)
Holy, holy, holy, holy (holy shit), you mean to tell me, tell me, tell
You're tough to love when you don't love yourself, well

Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family

My less exciting features are packed inside my body
They're crammed into the balcony, they're jamming up the lobby
They're falling out the window
You can see them crashing through the glass
When I don't keep my lids closed as the director flicks his wrist
The stagehand in the wing has got a silver chain he grips
And when he lifts it opens up the velvet curtains of my lips
And I say

Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family

We're not looking to wish on a star
We're no good at receiving the help
Who the hell do you think that you are?
Trying to make me believe in myself
You're like the sun in the summertime
I know you are but what am I?
I don't really wanna sound like a lullaby
But I think every family is a butterfly
You know, pretty from afar, pretty gross up close
Don't pity what we are, it's mostly unhideous
And I'm sitting at the bar with a beer
So cheers, come toast me
Get cozy since we're both lonely
Why don't we leap and then go see
What we become when it's done, it's dumb
But I'm not looking below, so don't ghost me
And it's seeming like we're in agreement
That the demon that we're fighting isn't the exact same
But if we're teaming up and carrying the weight together
We can miss a bit of back pain
And if you're into it then we can get up out the city
In a minute in the fast lane
Get hitched in a chapel in Vegas
Maybe get rich, life is a craps game
And I take my cue, from you
On what you wanna do 'bout a last name
It's not so bad to be a Watsky

Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family

Those fires in your attic that rage without permission
Some days invade your living room or break out in the kitchen
They breeze right through the building
They just show up as they please
And then retreat like grown up children
Well how'd you like to split this l and
Tell me what you've witnessed
If the price of life is hell
Well no one ever had to sell me on how nice a fire smells

Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family

And there's so much I've been silent on
But I'll whisper every secret to you when this mic is gone
And I know you'll listen (listen)
And I know it's different (different)
But it gives me peace our missing pieces could be siblings
The rough nights ain't leaving, so why the hell should we?
And I say

Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family

You deserve love (welcome to the family)
You deserve love (welcome to the family)
You deserve love (welcome to the family)
You deserve love
You deserve love (welcome to the family)
You deserve love (welcome to the family)
You deserve love (welcome to the family)

What Goes Up
It's too nice out
Let's play hooky
And get high 'til we both float away
We won't show today
Doesn't matter what they say
What goes up can stay (Uh, uh)

If you tell me I'm the one
While we're lying in the sun
Would you sign it on a piece of paper?
Do you know what you're about?
Could we live beyond our doubts
In a world where we don't need erasers?
Could you ever love a thief?
Can I steal away your grief
And suspend your disbelief?
Let's put on a show
'Cause it's never what you say
No, it's always in the way
That you say what you mean
Oh, oh, oh
Wrap your legs around my back
And hold me tight until we're talkin' in tongues
Then when we pass the spirit
We can yell forever at the top of our lungs

Just float
Just float
Just float

It's too nice out
Let's play hooky
And get high 'til we both float away
We won't show today
Doesn't matter what they say
What goes up can stay

Don't sweat the goons
All we do is crack a smile
When we hear 'em callin'
"You should go get a room"
Every stop to think the pollen in the air
Is from all the flowers fuckin' each other?
But why not let them bloom?
Let's get consumed
Outside, outside, outside
Inside o' you
So forget me not
We're doin' trust falls
Up at the mountaintop
C'mon, don't let me drop
Now that we've found a spot
And when we swung high on the pendulum
We just hung there in the sky

Just float
Just float
Just float

It's too nice out
Let's play hooky
And get high 'til we both float away
We won't show today
Doesn't matter what they say
What goes up can stay


Fuck it Up

Oh no, hey
Oh no, hey

Excuse me while I fuck it up
Please excuse me while I fuck it up
Excuse me while I fuck it up
Fuckin'

Wanna crash in slow-mo (Oh no)
Repeat our patterns and blow, oh no
I'm all plaid, you're all mad
The amateur saboteur's 'bout to go pro
What I know is that the people aren't runnin' the show
Any minute to another they come and they go
And they never gonna get what the government owe
So do what you gotta to pick up enough of the dough
I don't see the benefit of us comin' to blows
Give it a second, honey, I bet I'll be stubbin' my toe
What we got doesn't come by a lot
So we shoot every shot to work it out
But I'm dumb in love, out of touch
Is it too much or not enough?

Please excuse me while I fuck it up
Please excuse me while I fuck it up
I was just getting to know you

Wanna burn the house down (Oh yeah)
Pack up and get outta town (Oh yeah)
Drive without turning around
Arrive ridin' the waves and hold hands while we drown
Ain't no limit, never heard of high ceilings
Never timid, it's a certified G thing
Even after getting thirty-five bee stings
Still the motherfucker wouldn't hurt a fly's feelings
But being nice is sometimes not so nice
It's not so nice, no, no (Nice)
Got dropped, didn't stop
I was caught up in my life like
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Hey, better suck it up, buttercup
But I'd rather not look sharp
I was lookin' out for love and I puckered up
Better buckle up 'cause I fuck it up again and again
And I'm sick of thinking of my stupid-ass heart each time

Every time, every time, every time
Every time, every time, every time
Every time, every time, every time

Excuse me while I fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)
Please excuse me while I fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)
Please excuse me while I fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)
Again
Fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)
Fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)
Excuse me while I fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)
Again

Yeah
Hey
Hey, again
Hoo

Mean Ass Drunk

We're summoning spirits
We're tearing the labels
We're clearer than vodka
Don't bottle it up, don't bottle it up

Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?

Oh no (Oh shit)
Oh no (Oh shit)
Oh no (oh no no no no no no no no no)

You say it's your thing to be honest
Like it's kinda this token of pride
Well to be honest you are kind of a goddess
But being with you kinda kills me inside
You want me to explain it, well
It's sort of this look in your eye
Like you're cooking an egg
On the hood of a car
'Cause you looked at it hard
But my heart is the egg
And you're watching it fry
I'm not gonna cry
I'm not gonna lie
I am gonna cry
But not right here
Give me like a minute
Let me get up in my feelings
While I pop my beer
Shit is getting muddy
And I'm seeking out a buddy
At the bottom of my bottle
But it's not quite clear
What you expect from me
When you're disrespecting me

Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?

Oh no (Oh shit)
Oh no (Oh shit)
Oh no (oh no no no no no no no no no)

Wanna treat me like a dog on a leash
Well, that's your prerogative sheesh
But if she wanna see what we got
When the saga repeats, nada, capisce
I'm not a complete wretch
I fetch
I sit at bit
But I'm not gonna stay
But if you wanna see me
You can see my feets
And my cute little cheeks
When I'm walking away
You can see me sitting on the dock of the bay
You can see me licking on my crotch like a stray
But if you gotta see me like a prop in a play
Gotta say, I'll be skippin' what you got for today
Maybe you'll be thinking that I'm hot in the head
Or I'm sick and picking and at my chicken pox in the bed
You can think what you like
I think I'll take a hike

Oh no (Oh shit)
Oh no (Oh shit)
It's just one small complaint
I know I am no saint
Oh no (Oh no)
Oh shit (Oh shit)
Oh no
I think we're old enough to know what we ain't

We're summoning spirits (spit it out, spit it out, spit that shit out)
We're tearing the labels (get it off, get it off, get that shit off)
We're clearer than vodka (put 'em down, put 'em down, put that shit down)

Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?



No Complaints No Conversations
There's something wrong with her
There's something wrong with me
I don't think that's so wrong, we came by it honestly
And honestly, I think mostly everybody does
I don't blame you if you need to catch a buzz

I've built so much armor but ring the alarm
I'm in love with someone who's bringing me harm
I'll pick lovers who got monsters and we bond on mental health
Till they remind me of what's ugly in myself

But other than that
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
I got no complaints

I'm always on the brink
About to fly or sink
A minion with opinions told me that I shouldn't think so hard
That shit just made me think so hard
I couldn't sleep a wink
Washed my red flags with my white flags and now all my laundry's pink

I'm petty at best
Someone to pity at worst
Putty in beautiful hands
Potty mouth ready to curse
Cursed to be curious if all this is a scam
And I had to Google narcissist to check if that's what I am

But other than that
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
I got no complaints

Either you get nothing
But they make you pay and pay
Or you get it till they take it all away
Every day every day
It amazes me a hundred brand new faces
But I'm still trying to figure out who they is
Shit

I don't wanna settle one bit
Bet that I'm gonna battle for somebody but if
I look at what we got
And catch rot
Then I'm gonna come in with a hatchet and I cut it down quick
Cut around rust
Cut around mold
Everybody ends up cold
Heads gotta roll
That's life
And you gotta be the neck or the knife
But I'm told that I can't quite quit this

Constant itch to matter
My restless drive to win
That's driving me, that drove away the closest of my kin
How I twist away when deep relationships begin
And shit there's still the businesses of the thinness of my skin
I'm vain I'm lame I'm strange
And yet so typical
I make the same mistakes
I don't change shit and still
My folks age and age
I hate to face facts
And I feel I wear their faces as a mask

But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
I got no complaints




Feels Alright

Did the bull crush me or do I still give a fuck?
Is my heart ripped out or just shriveled up?
Add water and it's back like a brine shrimp
Rob, pimp, fuck, steal, murder, limp by, scrimp
Welcome to your life, kid, rock bottom shithole
Grab a shovel, dig down, try to hit coal
Santa's in the North Pole doing fentanyl
No more good little boys so he meant to kill himself
But he couldn't find a vein with the hot steel
He couldn't find himself at all, bitch, he's not real

Does it feel fucked up?
Does it feel fucked up?
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Does it feel fucked up?
Does it feel fucked up?

I'd be real dumb if I seem super
Every day we're diggin' out our souls with an ice cream scooper
Visine might clean our tears
But I fear you'd be worse off if your sight's clear
Don't like the view here, all my pyros
Go fill your eye droppers up with some nitro'
'Glycerin, discipline, steady with the hand
Wanna have your mind blown, ready for a bang?
Eyes wide open, let me know what you hear
Might be a slight ringin' in your ears

It's check-in time, how does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel? (Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?)
Feels alright
Feels alright
Feels alright

Pretty nice, huh?
We can go on for days like that



Limo 4 Emos

Limo for emos, limo for emos, limo for emos
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (Limo for emos, limo for emos)
(Let's go)
You've got knives in your broken heart
I'm outside in my go-kart
So cut your last pair
And put up your black hair in a bun
And come fast, we can run like mascara
You got force like Joan of Arc
And he falls short like Bonaparte
And you deserve greater, I know I'm no savior
But I'm here right now, so let's go
Kinda feels like we've been running every day of our lives
And shattering hearts and havin' ours cracked
But if you went and threw the broken hearts in a pile
And added the stack, then what do you have?
You in the black, deep in the red
If you're in your bed then you should come meet me instead
And out of the misery you know you've got a friend
Said you got me (You got me)
(Can't break you down)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (Limo for emos, limo for emos)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (Anytime, anywhere)
Cry and I'll be right there (Let's go)
They want us movin' at the speed of light but we won't hurry
Let's hit the city and stay out so late that it gets early
Like early on when we were livin' on the cheapest thrills
Because the town we fell in love with has the steepest hills
But those downs rebound to ups
Tried to push dad's coupe and torch the clutch
And they built us with extra gears and our cars run on ex's tears
Last night I realized I'm still sleepin' on my mattress edge
Saving room for someone who's not coming back to bed
But if we meet, I got room here in the shotgun seat
But if you'd rather take the keys, please, I'll put up my feet
We pay taxes, we live frugal
Wear new suits to old friends' funerals
Have true loves until they're false
But when you're down
But when you're down
But when you're down
But when you're down
But when you're down
Cry and I'll be right there
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (Cry and I'll be right there)
(Let's go)
Limo for emos (Let's go)
Limo for emos (Cry and I'll be right there)
Limo for emos (Let's go)
Limo for emos (Let's go)
Limo for emos (Let's go)
Limo for emos (Cry and I'll be right there)
(Let's go)
Limo for emos


Whitecaps
She's capsizing
And the sea keeps rising
And my kneecaps start to shake
If I can't save us
Will the sea come take us
When the white caps start to break
Women and children
First sight of the new world
We tried a lot
She cried a lot
She said the struggle is no more
We act the part
I cracked her heart
Am I still one of the good ones (that's a good one)
You wanna brawl
And crawl back into bed
But I can't move at all
I'ma store that in my head
I'm out here playing dead
We are not fit to duel
Our parents gave us different pistols
Taught us different rules
Your father was cruel
This man you resent
Is, despite your best intentions, what I represent
I say it isn't right
You say you always right be prepared to fight (be prepared to fight, to fight)
She's capsizing
And the sea keeps rising
And my kneecaps start to shake
If I can't save us
Will the sea come take us
When the white caps start to break
Women and children
First sight of the new world
The taste of cocaine
Dixieland pain, King James
Frank Ocean and Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts, Boy Scouts)
History's strange, rearranged plays
(James Franco, take it! Missed it, now) (that's a good one)
It's sick
The way we fight and spit
Somehow we find each other even when we're trying to quit
'Cause right behind how our shit, we like each other quite a bit
But I might admit it's pitiful the way the lie was split
A hundred thousand years and we're still trying to find the clit
But we don't have an ending yet
We get to write the script
It isn't gonna do to move our lips
We prove it with the chips (prove it with the chips)
She's capsizing
And the sea keeps rising
And my kneecaps start to shake
If I can't save us
(Women and children)
Will the sea come take us
When the white caps start to break
She's capsizing (women and children)
And the sea keeps rising
And my kneecaps start to shake
If I can't save us (women and children)
Will the sea come take us
When the white caps start to break
First sight of the new world
First sight of the new world
First sight of the new world
First sight of the new world

Placement

Advanced Placement
What's in the recipe of an identity?
How do we get to be here?
Am I a maniac? Am I a brainiac?
And will it ever be clear?
I've been sticking my pennies into the back of my piggybank
Getting permission before I'm petting the kitty cat
I've been taking a minute for really shedding the baby fat
What up, what up, what up, what up, what up?
This bizarre unfolding of my wings was quite a trip (Trip, trip, trip)
All the pretty colors in the sky began to
Ripple, drip and stipple like a Lichtenstein
Pimples on my mind
Hey, what's poppin' people? The apocalypse is nigh
Ever since the pitter patter of your little feet upon the patio
You knew you didn't want to be predictable
Coulda been so simple but you had to make it difficult
Got the city at your fingertip but got this shit to pull
Gotta keep on pushing it and pushing it and pushing till it falls down
Maybe you'll be laughing in the end
But I'ma keep at the edge of my seat 'cause you said what you needed
The web's undefeated, you do what you gotta: Hakuna Matata
So ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Gotta make it look easy
Simple as pie
Gotta make it look easy
But this life is never (never)
Never (never) never (never) never (never)
One big piece of cake
One big piece of cake
Big fat piece of cake
Never (never) never (never) never (never) never (never)
Your ass is now in advanced placement
You could be ready for heaven above
I could be seventy-seven and killin' it
Puffin' a jay that I keep in the glove
Right by the rubbers so we could be intimate
And if you're tucking me into my bed
Baby then maybe we'll make illegitimate cinema
We could take out the camera
Take a look at my stamina, so mechanical
I'm not even an animal, not a vegetable
I'm not even a mineral, but I'm mythical
I've become metaphysical when I dig in my tentacles
With the temperament of a savant
For the benefit of better people who want to pick apart the script
Instead of wishing to participate
I piss upon your head until it trickles to
Your tiny little brain and then disintegrates
I yell into your ear and hear an echo, echo, I'm a sicko, sicko
I say wake up, wake up, here's a stick up, stick up
While ya drink up (drink up) all
The hot gossip in your teacup (teacup)
I'm a (I'm a) cold faucet and I'm leaking
And if'n you're feeling wet
Check kisswatskysgluteusmaximus.net (Yeah)
Gotta make it look easy
Simple ass pie
Gotta make it look easy
But this life is never (never)
Never (never) never (never) never (never)
One big piece of cake
One big piece of cake
Big fat piece of cake
Never (never) never (never) never (never) never (never) never



Best Friend the Floor
[Hook]
I've been down before
(I've been down before)
I've been down before
(I've been down before)
I've been down before
(I've been down before)
I've been down before
My best friend, the floor




[Verse 1]
Met you in a parking lot out in Santa Cruz
Said your life's pretty dark now you have to choose
'Cause your home's not a home, not in any way
So on the phone, you were like "Um, anyway
Hey, think it's time that I end it all"
So I stall tryin' to not let you end the call
'Cause as long as you're here and you don't go
I won't have to face that I fear what I don't know


I've been doing donuts all around my head
Watch me flip my Miata, baby, now I'm dead


I'm a punk, such a punk, but I don't pretend to know you
I don't pretend to know you
So why should I say that you've got to stay
When every time I fell in love, I walked away?
Fair play, but this is not like that, no, it's not like that
This is not like that


We fit nice, hand to glove
So would you take some advice from a man in love?
'Cause the one, one thing that I know for sure
Is we're gonna get out, yeah, we're gonna get out


[Hook]
I've been down before
(I've been down before)
I've been down before
Yo, it's my best friend, the floor
I've been down before
(I've been down before)
I've been down before
My best friend, the floor


[Verse 2]
So I will lie on my back
And I will stare at the crack
On my ceiling, I would snap right in half
Just like the roof of our shack
It happened in the quake of 1989


And every time that I was not feeling fine
I'd ditch that crack and I would fall down the coast
Down to Santa Cruz, fall down to Santa Cruz
And I'm so lucky that I got friends, I'm so glad for that


And all my nonsense, they won't stand for that
So all my rejects hit the eject button, take a heat check, cousin
We could not be nothing if we wanted to
Wannabes, I wanna honor you
Shout out to all the cool kids out at Bonnaroo
Goner you, goner me, watch for the gonorrhea
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, honestly
Have your fun before the day is done
In the warm California sun


I said, I said, have your fun before the day is done
In the warm California sun


[Bridge]
Warm California sun
Warm California sun
Warm California sun
Warm California sun
Warm California sun
Warm California sun
(I've been down before)


[Outro]
Oh, shit, oh shit, it's my best friend
It's my best friend, the floor
Oh, shit, oh shit, it's my best friend
It's my best friend, hey
Oh, shit, oh shit, it's my best friend
It's my best friend, the floor
Oh, shit, oh shit, it's my best friend



Savage
You got me feeling like my tongue is a machete
Each time I think of you, I'm sharpening the blade
Does that make me savage?
Say I'll never hurt you while I twist the knife again
While I twist the knife again
Something I was sad about
While I twist the knife again
Something I was sad about
While I twist the knife again
Something I was sad about
All I want is everything that ever was and ever will be
You can kill me if you think that that's too much to ask
But if you shoot, I want the world's greatest death scene
And the world's collected treasure
Shoved inside my diamond-studded cask
And yeah, I covet love
So when I went and told her that I
Loved her like I never loved another
It was burning in my marrow
I could not imagine how my world was gonna spin, but it spun
And I know, so did I
If you need me, I'll be hiding over there
'Cause I want my fucking privacy
But also sometimes I would like to really overshare
A silly golden chair
A throne to call my own, a home for my entitled ass
Where I can act like I don't care
Climb Rapunzel's hair and then be donezo
Or a dunce cap and a stool
An empty corner that a fool can sit and stare at
And think on how I hurt her
Murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder
For whatever it's worth, I still hope that you're good
Just 'cause you can doesn't mean that you should
You got me feeling like my tongue is a machete
Does that make me savage?
You got me feeling like my tongue is a machete
Each time I think of you, I'm sharpening the blade
Does that make me savage?
Say I'll never hurt you while I twist the knife again



Undermine

[Intro: Watsky & Raquel Rodriguez]
Undermine, undermine, undermine
Undermine, undermine, undermine
Undermine, undermine, undermine


[Verse 1]
I don't know, I don't know
What to say, what to say
Either fuck you or I'm sorry
Guess it just depends on the day
Sorry for the damage I did
Fuck you for the years that we lost
Maybe there's no saving us left
But I still say I love you under my breath
[Chorus: Watsky & Raquel Rodriguez]
Undermine, undermine, undermine
Under my breath
Undermine, undermine
Under my breath
Undermine, undermine, undermine
Under my breath
Undermine, undermine


[Verse 2: Watsky]
All the walls, all the walls
Rip 'em down, rip 'em down
Every nail, every nail
Pull 'em out, pull 'em out with your teeth
I've been busy biting my tongue
Now I got the bloodiest grin
I hope you live a wonderful life
But you're finished living under my skin


[Chorus: Watsky & Raquel Rodriguez]
Undermine, undermine, undermine
Under my skin
Undermine, undermine
Under my skin
Undermine, undermine, undermine
Under my skin
Undermine, undermine
Under my skin
Under my skin


[Verse 3: Watsky]
It's a pity a part of me's so petty
My tendency is to pick at the old scabs
Maybe you could forever be unready
I'm not ready to say that there's no chance
Take whatever is heavy and hold steady
I'll be surfing the ebb and the flow
Working on letting it go
Looking for heaven above
Living in heaven below


Listen, I know that we're getting bigger
I figure the clock is ticking, but if I'm digging and digging
And hitting nothing but rock I'll be stopping until I'm useful
I know that soon it'll become a possibility
We're not gonna be meeting till we're at another funeral


Had an epiphany, I know you're not my enemy
And if I'm thinking different the distance'll be the death of me
Destiny hasn't ever been part of my life philosophy
But I believe in opening every window you find
If your window's missing, you draw a frame on the side of the wall
With a silver Sharpie and then you open it wide
If it doesn't open, at least you know that you tried
And what can you do but try?
Maybe you and I were never meant to be tight
But say that we were to live for a ten-century life
You could always change your mind
Right up to 999


[Outro: Watsky]
Undermine, undermine, undermine
Undermine, undermine
Undermine, undermine, undermine
Undermine, undermine



Dreams and Boxes

Part I: Dreams
I think I know where all my problems come from (California)

I never really had the guts to look under that log
I need them all, all, all to love me
But they see through me so easy

I wish I could believe in your God
Sounds fun, we could throw rocks out of heaven

I get these dark thoughts every day now
I never thought I'd be that one
Good news, I'm way too scared to do it

And I have too much fun being scared
I'm in this for life
Like it or not
I'm not going anywhere, anywhere

I'm in this for life
Like it or not
You will have to drag me by the neck

I'm not gonna bail
Writing on the ceiling of the box while the coffin is nailed

California dreamin' while the demons are hot on our tail
Hop a curb, yes, that was me off of the trail, officer
No, I don't have a good reason
I was just in a mood to go seekin'
Heard a hard poem, it had my heart thumpin'
Start my blood pumpin' again


This one is for the people who raised me up
It's for the people who raised me up
If you remember one thing, then remember how it felt
When you fell for the first time
This one is for the people who raised me up
It's for the people who raised me up
If you remember one thing, then remember how it felt

I'm in this for life
I'm not going anywhere, anywhere
I'm in this for life
Drag me by the neck

You want your holy grail
Try not to overthink it
I try but always fail
But I want it so damn bad
I'm addicted to life

If I lived how I thought that you want me to live
I don't think you'd like what you got
If I shot my poetry out of a cannon
Would it make it any better?
If you fill a gun with glitter
What'll become of the bullet
If you're only suffering under a veil?


I'm in this for life
Like it or not
I'm not going anywhere, anywhere
I'm in this for life
Like it or not
You will have to drag me by the neck

This one is for the people who raised me up
It's for the people who raised me up
If you remember one thing, then remember how it felt
When you fell for the first time
This one is for the people who raised me up
It's for the people who raised me up
If you remember one thing, then remember how it felt
Part II: Untitled Spoken Word Poem
I dreamed I understood myself completely

We were having a party in a house falling out of the sky

Every clique showed up

The ones who love the smell of gasoline
The shy beautifuls
The microphone eaters
The gimme gimme gimmes
The maybe next years
The boring childhooders who trashed their lives for fun
The house rotated as it made it through the storm
Eyeball-sized hail sailed sideways through the windows

As the single pane, survived-the-great-fire hundred-year-old glass all smashed
We laughed
and dropped the hailstones in our drinks and danced
We started chanting something optimistic that we knew was maybe mostly bullshit

That if we even still felt one-tenth of one percent how we felt in that moment in the morning
That it would be an energy that could shake neighborhoods from their foundations

We dragged ourselves on a twenty-mile mission to fill our goblets in the kitchen

I got stopped by a hallway goblin named Frank
Who said he once dreamed Karl Marx and Rosa Parks were beating the shit out of him
Which gave him a full-body orgasm

I told him my dad analyzes dreams for a living
and believes they're portals to the subconscious
And I believe him and I don't judge you, we're all weirdos
My dad still refuses to drive Beemers because they made cars for Hitler
But I always suspected that that was convenient logic
For a family that could only afford used station wagons

I told him how in a drawer in my house I found a matchbook from my dad's 1955 Bar Mitzvah
It still had nine dry unused matches that hadn't been torn from the cardboard

It's a time machine and remains my second most prized possession

Do you understand this, Frank?

You're in the presence of a motherfucker who owns fire from the past
Can you imagine getting high with a flame from 1955? Can you?
Do you feel connected to your ancestors? Do you?
Do you ever feel strange? Wonder how the world's gaze has shaped you?

Do you fear being shaken by the shoulders like an Etch A Sketch
Being mugged for your memories? I do
They are my first most prized possession

My very first memory was sitting in a high chair with my brother the day the Bay ripped in two

The earthquake shook the china from the shelves
and we clapped because we didn't understand
I told him how my mother's father died in a plane crash

I told him how my brother grew up to be a pilot
And then the captain, which apparently the building had and was my brother
Came over the intercom, which apparently the building had
And alerted the party that the house was starting to spin faster
And soon it would be time for us to hit the ground

So either buckle your seatbelts, say your prayers
Or find someone who wants to fuck you
China was smashing against the ceiling

Me and Frank said our goodbyes easily once I realized I'd been having a conversation in the mirror the whole time

I climbed out a window, clung to a drainpipe, and watched the stars paint the sky


Part III: Boxes
Little boxes on the hillside

(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my elbows, ass, and my knees and toes, I got my)
Little boxes on the hillside

(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my)

I see the ghosts on every corner
Of the people that we used to be

So many that they sit upon the shoulders of their brothers and their sisters
As our city slips into the sea

Danny in a DC tee gettin' stomped in the head on Clement Street
Kids in the black boots
Dad's got the long hair, Dad's gettin' hired, gettin' fired
Everybody wave (Me in the ambulance!)
Mom's got my pills in a paper bag, bills on the table
That's before they were really real people
And the punks grabbed my bike in the Safeway parking lot
Chased 'em for five blocks, never got it back

Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my elbows, ass, and my knees and toes, I got my)
Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my)

We were already fading, we just didn't know it yet
Holdin' onto the lie of my perfection tucked under my arm like a late Blockbuster cassette
And fuck yeah, I was hard for Miss Popular
Been jockin' her but she couldn't see where I sat with binoculars

Binaca stashed in my pocket, shot my good shot, the good Lord, she blocked it
Cherish the small tragedies
The big ones are smokin' out in the bathroom and loiterin' for the moment when nobody sees 'em comin'
An openin' they can jump in and make a total catastrophe
My family tried to hold it together
But now that we can't hold it together
We'll hold each other closer instead

Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my elbows, ass, and my knees and toes, I got my)
Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my)

Danny in the deep blue sea getting wasted on the MUNI out to DP
Kids with the tall cans
Dad's got the short hair, Dad's not retired quite yet
Everybody wave (Me in the ambulance!)
Mom plays guitar and she sings to us at night

That was before we were really real people
And the punks grabbed my bike in the Safeway parking lot
Chased 'em for five blocks, never got it back

Little boxes on the hillside
There's a blue one and a yellow one
And they all look just the same


The Price of Growing Up

[Verse 1]
We're just some fleas on the back of some slightly bigger fleas
On a dog on a boat full of holes that barely floats
On a sea full of souls full of secrets we can't know
Facing facts isn't nice


[Hook]
But it's the price of growing up
It's the price of growing up
It's the price of growing up
It's the price of growing up
[Verse 2]
We get to drive, get to smoke, get to fuck and vote and booze
Get to bruise like a peach when we lose it all
But you only lose what was gained, and we gained so much
So thanks (Thanks!) for the drinks (Cheers!)
Here's the check

[Hook]
It's the price of growing up
It's the price of growing up
It's the price of growing up
It's the price of growing up

[Hook]
It's the price of growing up
It's the price of growing up
It's the price of growing up
It's the price of growing up


Border in My Heart
Hook]
I know the forces
Of good and evil
Wage a war inside of every heart
But I won't build a, build a border
Inside my heart!

[Verse 1]
I'm coming in strong
If you're not angry, what the fuck's wrong with ya?
I'd rather be a lover than a fighter
But if you don't fight, the fight'll come get ya anyway
The stakes are too high
If you ride the fence, you picked the wrong side
Being polite has been beyond tried
If you're sick of shit, think it's time to say
[Bridge]
This is not normal
This is not normal
Don't let this be normal

[Hook]
I know the forces
Of good and evil
Wage a war inside of every heart
But I won't build a, build a border
Inside my heart!

[Verse 2]
If I don't respect ya, I don't salute ya
I don't respect ya, I don't expect to
I'm no saint, but these are no humans
Fill up their purse and watch all the world ruined
If that was too vague, Donald J. Trump is a thug and a plague
And if he signed your check you belong at The Hague
Hey! Everybody sing it now

[Bridge]
This is not normal
This is not normal
Don't let this be normal

Embrace the Quake
[Verse 1]
My city is the best
My people are the best
My ego is a bulletproof vest, I know
I'm aiming at the heart
I'm famous to my mom
I'm gonna play my part, I was born for it
Hell yeah, I've been afraid
I'm shaking in my boots
I do it anyway
I'm a fool poet
You're nothing special
'Til something special cli- cli- cli- cli- cli- cli- cli- clicks
[Bridge]
If you could know
When you would die
Give you the date and time
Would you agree?
Would you feel free
If you could plan your life?

[Verse 2]
I do my mushrooms on the first of the year
I got a swimming pool that's filled up with fear
Another swimming pool that's filled up with love
Cannonball, cannonball, it's death from above

[Hook]
Do you fear that you fear too much?
Do you feel that you feel too much?
Embrace the quake
Embrace the quake
Do you fear that you fear too much?
Do you feel that you feel too much?
Embrace the quake
Embrace the quake

[Bridge]
If you could turn all of your fears into a living beast
Then could you stare dead in its eye?
Would you be scared?
Dead in the eye
Dead in the eye
Dead in the eye
Would you be scared?
Dead in the eye

Black Hole Eyes
Verse]
Pull my tongue out, rip my head off
Paint the galaxy with what you find inside
How'd you like to grab on where our wings should be
And pull each other open wide?
Been thinking being trapped alive in amber
Wouldn't be an awful way to die
Little spider, little spider, look me in the eye
Hover over me and smother me
Don't let me draw another breath tonight
We only get one shot at being torn to pieces
I think we could get it right
It's been a boring couple years
And I could use a good obliteration now
[Interlude]
Black hole eyes
The first time I looked in your eyes
You sucked me into the void
I look forward to being destroyed
Black hole eyes

[Outro]
Fuck me up
Fuck me up
Fuck me up
Come on, fuck me up
Fuck me up
Come on, fuck me up
(Black hole eyes)
Fuck me up
Fuck me up
Fuck me up
Come on, fuck me up
Fuck me up
Come on, fuck me up

INTENTION

 THE PLAN IS A MESS
Cross-checked with GENIUS (Watsky is a verified contributor)
[Chorus]
Yes, the plan is a mess
Mess is part of the plan
Swan dive into the noise 
And fate can never catch us
We can never fall

Feels like so long ago that I was ditching plan A
Switching it to plan B
Hit another hitch and I can my plan C
Dash my plan D, then burn E, F and G an effigy
I’m still scufflin’ right past my plan Z
So I had to give ‘em first names like hurricanes
Plan “Myrtle” came down like purple rain
Plan “Kareem” careened off a cliff
And then Plan “Cliff” got smoked like a spliff
Plan “Diff” biffed it
Plan “Kate” ate it
Man placates himself, claims it’s fated

They say everything happens for a reason
I say everything happens, the reason’s postdated
I’m so jaded, I’m so solidly
On some kiss my ass to astrology 
Shit just happens and we find a way
(That’s such a Virgo thing to say)

[Chorus]
Yes, the plan is a mess
Mess is part of the plan
Swan dive into the noise 
And fate can never catch us
We can never fall

I’m happy to let you think that this was my intention
Part of my invention right from the beginning, fail my way to winning
All in the risk-reward up on my vision board
Ready to rip the cord when I’m in the air freefalling
I just woke up in a motel outside Nashville
All my money’s spent and my band is gone
La-la-la-la-la, life’s a country song
I’ll tell you to fight on, tell me I’m an icon
I cannot survive long living without applause
Don’t want to take a pause, why did I make my cause
Building the myth of myself? (Vanity) (gunnin’ it)
Beta cuck made a buck bitching on my problems
Even though that everybody and their momma got some
(Pop gun) We’re robbin’ the bank and shooting a blank
It's not a job I could ever fake
(Time to run)

[Chorus]
Yes, the plan is a mess
Mess is part of the plan
Swan dive into the noise 
And fate can never catch us
We can never fall

Watsky (spoken):
It has been a minute but we are back motherfuckers.
Me and my friends made this record for you.
They are all producers, they’re musicians, they’re quality human beings.

Give it up for Max Miller Loran on the keys and horn!
Kush Mody on the keys and bass!
Chukwudi Hodge aka Michael Duble on the drumset! 

Chukwudi:
Let’s fucking go!

Watsky:
Mr Cormack ‘cause we got the Bay in the house! (Ehh)
Camila Recchio ‘cause we got Seattle in the house! (Ehh)
Pat Dimitri! Who’s not on guitar ‘cause he’s slanging NFTs now (Noooo) but give it up for independent artists not being broke. We love to see that. Come on!!

Other (spoken):
Ok ok ok.

Watsky (spoken):
Give it up for life! Being a series of deeply personal choices and compromises. 
I know I did my best for you! And I really hope you enjoy. You can call me by my family name.


WHAT’S THE MOVE?
Cross-checked with GENIUS
Watsky!
[T-Pain]
Hey, T-Pain
Nappy Boy
Uh, uh (hey!)
(Yeah!)

[Chorus]
Just one chance and I ain’t tryna lose it
Moving like this is all I’m ever choosing (hey!)
We’re in the right place and I ain’t tryna lose this groove
What you saying? Tell me, what’s the move?

[Watsky]
We got to move, I want you, boo
You want me too (hey)
If you got ass, then move that ass
And touch me too (touché)
Gadunkadunk built like a Tonka truck
Backing it up like beep beep
All your friends pregnant, but the butt’s big
And it’s jiggling magnificently (Goddamn!)
Bodies want us to do the thang
Body wants me to shoot my thang (Bang, bang)
What you got in your future plans?
Why the fuck should we use our brains? (ay, ay)
I know we want it, you’re ready to back up on it
Your booty is like a haiku, your body is like a sonnet, poetical 
Deep into my ventricles, feeding me chemicals 
Heating my kettle, getting me feeling I want to settle

Like doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Do you wanna make a baby?
(Are you fucking crazy?!)

[Chorus - T-Pain]
Just one chance and I ain’t tryna lose it
Moving like this is all I’m ever choosing
We’re in the right place and I ain’t tryna lose this groove
What you saying? Tell me, what’s the move?

[Verse - Watsky]
Are we crazy to jump in, baby, into this mosh pit?
Aww shit, what is the move?
Too many different directions that we could pick
If we’re getting busy living, we gotta choose
We could go anywhere pack your favorite guitar
Buy two horses, fuck around in UIaanbataar
Making love on the steppe, dreaming under the stars
Get off the grid or go shake the culture we could
Sling it, sling it, go-go up and down like yo-yo
Do we float or row, row? The tsunami’s here, so
Do we ride it? Do we fight it?
Live inside it? Live outside it?
(What’s the move?)
Nothing against you picking the picket fence if you’re into it
We all got different visions of joy
What’s the move?
The decision of what to do with our body’s the definition of freedom, so check your boy
(What’s the move?)
If I’m getting the choice and taking that shit for granted
We get a single trip on the planet, you got to pick your path
(What’s the move?)
Unless it’s fated, we get reincarnated
And then we’re fuckin’ running it back!

[Chorus - T-Pain]
Just one chance and I ain’t tryna to lose it
Moving like this is all I’m ever choosing
We in the right place and I ain’t tryna lose this groove
What you saying? Tell me, what’s the move?
What’s the move?
What’s the move?
What’s the move?
What’s the move?
What’s the move?
What’s the move?
What’s the move?
What’s the move?
(Hey!) What’s the move?
What’s the move?
What’s the move?
What’s the move?
What’s the move?
Tell me, what’s the move?
What’s the move?
Tell me, what’s the move?

[Outro - Spoken:]
[T-Pain]
This shit is fucking hard!
This is hard.

[Watsky]
No– no-one’s– no-one’s arguing with you. (smirks)

People are gonna be like, “What’s this sample?” (“What’s this sample” echoes)
We made that shit.


ROLLIN
Lyrics Officially Released (Jan 27)
[Intro - Spoken, Camilia Recchio:]
I looked in the mirror and I was like “Oh but you know if I just do some squats. 
I want it to stay exactly like this [laughing]”

When we were younger grown folk used to say:
"Our bad that we fucked up the earth (Our bad, our bad)
But we know you'll clean up the mess we made
We know you kids will break the curse!"

Keep bowlin', keep the ball rollin'
Our vibe's too golden to get our time stolen
So social climbers — free solo a dick
And if you fall from the wall keep yolo-ing quick
Because the record spins and the globe does too
And the hits keep raining down
We keep it rolling (new shit!)
Keep it rolling (new shit!)

Rollin'
Can't stop us rollin' down the hill
The kids are always better when they're
Rollin'
They always build a better wheel
The kids will always do it better

Now we're all grown we know just what to say:
"We know you kids'll break the curse
Yeah we know you won't make the same mistakes we did"
The new kids are here to do better than this
The youth's coming up quick, and rewriting the hits (new shit!)
Like when shit gets too familiar
Let's take some big kid steps to the next, to the next
Don't let that boat sail away, sail away
'Cause the future won't stop at you

'Cause the eyes'll roll, then the heads'll roll, but the roll don't stop
Hot tub full of botox, we're mobbin' over no roadblocks
We'll see you in a minute baby, we're

Rollin'
Rollin'
The kids are always better when they're
Rollin'
Rollin'
The kids will always do it better



Paper Nihilist
Lyrics Officially Released (Jan 31)
[Chorus]
You say that you believe that
That nothing matters
I see the logic
But do you feel it in your heart tonight?
What do you feel, feel, feel?
(Paper Nihilist)

[Verse 1]
On some level are we all a single entity? (I don't know)
Swirling in the ball of universal energy? (I don't know)
Well then how come when I dwell on my stupid stuff
I get stuck and I just come undone mentally?
Silly little petty human brain with my petty pain
Really tryna' shackle me with vain
Metal mental chains
While I hold this lucky ticket, mayne
How could I complain?
Yet I'm here again up in my head
Going up in flames
But I gotta chill
And scissor kick my inner critic
Lift us over the pacific
In a floating Honda Civic
Get untethered from invented
Pressure heavy as a feather
Whether trekking through a blizzard
In the middle of the desert of my soul

Living is the goal
Loving is the way
Suffering's the toll
We all gotta pay
If we wanna roll
While we got today-day-day

[Chorus]
You say that you believe that
That nothing matters
I see the logic
But do you feel it in your heart tonight?
What do you feel, feel, feel?

[Verse 2]
Do you look at life and think 'that's it?' (I don't know)
That humanity's a big trash pit? (I don't know)
Or we're actors in a big, bad skit?
Do the cold facts fit?
Now I don't know jack-shit
But you got the right to feel
(How you're fuckin' feeling)
I'm a plebe and I
(Don't know what is real)
I believe we should
(Make this bucket squeal)
Try (Spin the lucky wheel)
Try (Let the rubber peel)

Dammit we're all stranded on this big ol’ ball of granite
But I'm singing while I'm hanging out the window of the planet
Yeah I'm damaged but I ham it up
And so you could put this ham up on a sammich
If you're famished you could bite me till we vanish, cause

If it doesn't matter either way
Why not go and have some fun today?
(You say that you believe that)
If it doesn't matter either way
(You say that you believe that)
Why not go and have some fun fun fun?

[Chorus]
You say that you believe that
That nothing matters
I see the logic
But do you feel it in your heart tonight?
What do you feel deep in your heart?

Paper Nihilist
Paper Nihilist
Paper Nihilist

Do you feel it in your heart tonight?
Do you feel it in your heart tonight?
Do you feel it in your heart tonight?
What do you feel, feel, feel, feel, feel?

AWW SHiT
Lyrics Officially Released (Dec 15)
[Chorus: Watsky, Hollis, and both]
It's like, aww, shit, what the fuck's up?
What's the fuck's up? What the fuck's up?
Like, oh, shoot, whatcha gonna do now?

[Verse 1: Watsky]
Oh, shoot! I'm back in action dripping different like I'm au jus
You know what, with my battalion, you don't do?
That's bet against the Cali Stallion
I know it's been a minute but I'm back up in it and I'm here to win it
If I got dumb hope, then that's all that I need
To get up on my steed and ride into the gun smoke
I'm in the gym, using my jimmy to jump rope
So gimme one poke, and the theme from Rocky plays
Better walk away if you don't want a K-O from a GOAT
[Pre-Chorus: Hollis]
I don't always feel I'm on the ball
It's not always my complaints feel small
I don't always feel I'm 9 plus 9 plus 9 feet tall
But when I do, ooooh

[Chorus: Watsky, Hollis, and both]
(It's like)
Aww, shit, what the fuck's up?
What's the fuck's up? What the fuck's up?
Like, oh, shoot, whatcha gonna do now?

[Verse 2: Gifted Gab]
Get the fuck off me, I'm rolling with Watsky
We go together like crickеt to Aussies
Killin' 'em softly
What do you mean? My bitchеs is costly
So please don't accost me
We moving at top speed, Mach 5
Dead or alive, I'm in top three
All of these niggas my offspring
All in the church with no offering
I was in the dirt outside, put in work
You was in your room on screens
That's why you callin' me aunty
Don't disrespect the Givenchy
I'm just an evergreen standing amongst all these palm trees
Aww, shoot, aww, shiet

[Chorus: Watsky & Hollis and Gifted Gab]
Aww, shit, what the fuck's up?
What the fuck's up, what the fuck's up? (It's like)
Oh, shoot, whatcha gon' do?

[Background: Oh my god ha ha ha]

[Verse 3: Watsky, Watsky & Hollis]
Peacockin', walkin' it so arrogant
The pickpocket of bliss is comparison
This condition gripping all Americans
Break our kneecap, it won't make us Kerrigan
It's jealousy, you must be taking LSD to step to me
Fellas, my destiny, from the SFC Bay to the Chesapeake
Is freakin' cheffin' the shit out my recipe
Yes, I begin to climb out my cocoon
Spreading my wings to take it to the moon
'Cause I just want to stick my chin up high
And then get both arms swinging, baby, side to side
There's still time to ride my wagon
But if you're lagging then bye, bye, baby, bye, bye

[Pre-Chorus: Hollis]
I don't always feel I'm- (I don't always feel I'm-)
Don't always- (Don't always-)
Don't always feel I'm 9 plus 9 plus 9 feet tall
But when I do, ooooh
[Chorus: Watsky, Hollis, and both]
(It's like)
Aww, shit, what the fuck's up?
What's the fuck's up? What the fuck's up?
Like, oh, shoot, whatcha gonna do now?
Hey!
Aww, shit, what the fuck's up?
Aww, shit, what the fuck's up?
Aww, shit, what the fu-fu-fuck's up?
Aww, shit, what the fuck's up?
What's the fuck's up? What the fuck's up? Yeah, yeah
Oh, shoot, whatcha gonna do, do, do, do?

Oh my God, we’re so famous
It’s too easy

[Watsky]
Draw, bang, while the dummies reload
If you wanna win the game, why not use a cheat code?
Check out all the suckers stuck in traffic on the high road
While you’re doing ninety with your wide load on the shoulder
We could get to Scotland in a hot sec
If you’re ready to go swimming in the fuckin’ Loch Ness
If you knuckle up, swinging at the fuckin’ wasp nest
Let the competition drop like a pretty prom dress (whoop!)
Go buck, folks love a hot mess
Who gives a fuck who you fuck in the process?
Want press? We love it when you’re shameless
We want to make you famous

[Garth]
Click, click
I heard a camera flash
That pic worth two stacks, so run my cash
In the morning, you hoes’ll be nameless
As for me and my crew, famous

You make ‘em look at you and make ‘em say “ooh”
You get the duchets, yeah, you make ‘em pay you
You fill your pockets and they cannot say “boo”
You don’t have to like it
But your rent, they’re gonna hike it
Doesn’t take a psychic
You know that’s the way that it is
You don’t gotta fight it
Get the crowd excited
Get the flame ignited
Will you grab ‘em by the heart?
(They won’t let me go)
Are you gonna play your part?
(Baby, every show)
Were you born to be a star?
(You already know)
(Woooo! Kill ‘em)

[Garth]
Click click, I heard a camera flash
Show me three stacks and I’ll shake some ass
By tomorrow, you hoes’ll be nameless
As for me and my crew, famous
(So famous)
Oh my God, I’m so famous
Am I a God? I’m so famous
It’s too easy

[Watsky]
Look at my outrage
I’m so mad I might just park you on the front page
Make you sit there ‘til you really had a good think
Man, the devil really thought he had us hoodwinked
Winkin all the way to the belly of the piggy bank, full
Horns to the china and you’re really that bull 
Let the sheep keep bleating while you’re slanging that wool
What grift are you ready to pull?
How far would you go for some access?
How tight is your back pressed?
To the wall!
Could you lie with your whole chest?
Want blood turn it cold fleshed,
I’m appalled!
You might run the carnival
But I’m clicking on your article
(Oh no)
Thinking I’m the better man
But you’re living in my head again (Oh, oh no)
(Oh my god)

(Onwards is missing from Genius)
[Garth]
I know, it’s obsession 
(I’m a god)
Control, my direction
(Living in my head again)
The glow of my reflection (my reflection)
(Living in my head again)
Console, my rejection
(Living in my head again)
My reflection
(Living in my head again)
It’s my projection

You might not always like me, but
You can’t deny me ‘cause
I’m in your heart
And that’s the place to start
To see that I’m the fuckin’ truth

People figure that they got the facts
Would you rather get to know me or live easy?
If you had to pick, 'cause you don't get to pick both
If you want the growth, you’re not ever gonna get to go back
But I’ll hit you like a freight-train gut punch in the middle of a pitch-black night (black night)
Sink deeper than a foot-long butt plug (butt plug)
But I’m cheaper than a free lunch
I’m thicker than a corn-fed farmhand
Bigger than the shit you planned
Clearer than a two buck proof pure liquor river
In a glass liver made of pure white sand

You might not always like me, but
You can’t deny me ‘cause I’m in your heart
And that’s the place to start
To see that I’m the fuckin’ truth
I’m the fuckin’ truth
(Oh yeah)
I’m the fuckin’ truth
I’m the motherfuckin’ truth
(Oh yeah)

Every generation’s human, ain’t no motivations movin’
Only separation’s new technology
But that won’t get you closer to the truth
People wanna live their lives
A crab in a bucket strugglin’ to survive
Eating and fucking and sleeping and loving a good fight!
I saw you hit that pipe
While you were chilling in the city limits
I caught you late that night
The temperature was in the single digits
Tucking a Trojan inside of your jacket pocket
And hoping that getting lucky was coming to be
Unsure if you were getting closer or further from me (me, me, me)
You were out in Dakota and feeling alone
I was the open road
You were tweaking, seeking answers in the love of a crowd
I was the question, though
You were not quite ready to speak every weakness aloud
I was your microphone
You were searching for me at the boundary, but I was right at home
With my feet on your couch, even though you were still sitting there
I was eating you out of your Frigidaire
I would dance on your tomb like I’m Fred Astaire
To the ten million times that I didn’t care
And what you had to go through, it isn’t fair
But if you hear me say that you’ve got today
Then you do
And you should believe me, cuz I’m the fuckin’ truth

Yeah I’m the fuckin’ truth
I’m the fuckin’ truth
Oh yeah I’m the fuckin’ truth
I’m the mother fuckin’ twoof (Oh yeah!)

You might not always like me but
You can’t deny me
‘Cause I’m in your heart
And that’s the place to start to see that I’m the fuckin’ truth
I’m the fuckin’ truth
(Oh yeah)
I’m the fuckin’ truth
And that’s the place to start to see that I’m the fuckin’...



MILE AWAY

[Verse 1: Watsky & Rachel Zegler]
You never kept it secret, but forgive me if I cry
The first thing you promised is we would say goodbye
But you didn't say when, didn't say how (Ooh)
Tell me not to stress and to keep my head down
But I peeped and I—

[Chorus: Rachel Zegler]
Now you can see me comin' from a mile away

[Verse 2: Watsky]
I didn't write the play, but I still got lines to say
Got my life today
Got my pages and I'm a pro
So I know that the show's gotta go when the light's bright on stage (Places!)
Life is mean, it's been months since I've seen her
But I still got that picture of us down in Argentina on my wall
Why not do it again? When I know how it ends
Coulda seen it

[Chorus: Rachel Zegler]
Comin' from a mile away (Ooh)
Comin' from a mile away
Comin' from a mile away (A mile away)
Comin' from a milе away (A mile away)
Comin' from a mile away

[Verse 3: Watsky & Rachel Zegler]
I used to think I'd been built to racе
I'd run uphill at a filthy pace for like fifty years (Ooh)
Fuck that shit, better fill a vase
Pick some roses and chill a case of like fifty beers (Yeah)
Here's spending too many nights runnin' inside of my mind
From what I can spy, come in, come knockin' on
I'm a creaky back door, no sneak attacks, dork, pop a cork
It's another year, another party
Well, can you believe December's here?
Of course I can
We say that same shit every fucking year
Let's get the next one out the way right now
“Oh, my, oh, my goodness, can you believe it’s alread-”  We're not slowin' down (yea, slowin’ down)
Time keeps runnin', but we do too
So would you mind if I got old with you
There's no time to miss the past
The future is coming fast and it's singin' to us

[Chorus: Rachel Zegler]
Now you can see me comin' from a mile away (Comin' from a mile away)
(Comin' from a mile away)
(Comin' from a mile away)
(Comin' from a mile away)
Comin' from a mile away
Comin' from a mile away (Woah)
Now you can see me comin' from a mile away (Now you can see me comin' )
Comin' from a mile away (Yeah)
Comin' from a mile away
Comin' from a mile away (Yeah)
Comin' from a mile away

“Official” lyrics added by Watsky over on Genius.
(Alright I gotchu)
Hey, better hit the damn drum (Ooh, yea, better)
Better hit the damn drum (smack it)
Better hit the damn drum gotta keep the time
Better hit the damn drum gotta keep the mind tickin
In the mad life chaotic and wicked
Dickin’ around with sound, found religion
The rhythm giving neat division
To disarray, when nothing is clicking
But it's okay, ee cut the pandemonium up 
To ticker-tape and strut in it
The structure give us some significance?
Dust each coincidence off, you’ll find my fingerprints
Kidding, kidding I’m a clown prince not a vision- ary
Run the numbers the drummer’s a mathematician

When shit’s gray like Dorian, Drift my delorean
I’m a click away from the bay to the Korean peninsula
To Pennsylvania to the Philippines
On the scene getting mean on the philistines
You tend to bring the force once you got a brain
Hung like a horse and a tongue like a guillotine

I’m coming sharper than killer bee stingers
While I’m bringing you the illest soliloquy 
If you really put your ear to this then you will agree
What you’re really hearing is authentic ability

Feelin’ me not required, its elective
Grow the fuck up admit art’s subjective
What you can relate to and the perspective
And my perspective is some folks defective
Now, now don't cry there's a lot of dumb guys 
Think they’re on earth flat like a papadam
Papa don’t preach but son gotta pop a Tums
If guts was cookies these dudes got not a crumb

Yes with success I do got a modicum
Come properly but I do have the thought of, um
Am I problematic or a problem on the mic?
“Why not both?” (Little meme shrug)
If you really sip the bean in my mean mug
You can see i'm a fiend for this drug
Culture Vulture Got that plug (butt)

Whatever you think of it
I’m a product of the record industry syndicate
Go ahead and pretend we live inside of a vacuum
You’ll be covered in a bunch of itchy ass lint and shit

If I tell you that I’m humble I’m pinocchio
And if I’m navel gazing when my nose’ll grow
Thats a ritual seppuku so I’m sending you back to 
your regularly scheduled braggadocio
Do-si-do around the clowns, hit a little flex
Speaking in calligraphy while they’re in simple text
I got a riddle hot off the griddle keep all your 
Heads on a swivel, I got the kibble to feed the internets
Ripple effects for every decision, my nipples erect 
I got a new vision but it intersects with
My shipwrecks from every mission I’ve been in 
The ending is the beginning so what if I hit the deck?
Cause we’ll pop corks if you saw us on tour 
come and sip the next brew if you want more
I’m not dead in the morgue, too hot to be a borg
Watsky might be dead, but you still got George
